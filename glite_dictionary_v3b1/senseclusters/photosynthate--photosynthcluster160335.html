        <blockquote><b>Photosynthate</b> sugar</blockquote><blockquote>The leaves produce <b>photosynthate</b> during the day and send it to the roots for storage.</blockquote><blockquote>Scientists measured the amount of <b>photosynthate</b> transported to the fruit after exposure to sunlight.</blockquote><blockquote>A shortage of sunlight can reduce the total <b>photosynthate</b> available for plant growth.</blockquote><blockquote>Scientists studied how <b>photosynthate</b> produced by algae supports marine food webs.</blockquote><blockquote>The movement of <b>photosynthate</b> from cyanobacteria to other organisms is crucial in aquatic ecosystems.</blockquote><blockquote>Researchers tracked the flow of <b>photosynthate</b> to understand energy transfer in ocean environments.</blockquote>
