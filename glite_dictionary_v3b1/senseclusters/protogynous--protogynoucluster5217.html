        <blockquote><b>Protogynous</b> fish species</blockquote><blockquote>Some species of fish are <b>protogynous</b>, starting life as females and later changing to males.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>protogynous</b> flowers of this plant help prevent self-pollination and encourage cross-pollination.</blockquote><blockquote>Researchers observed that the <b>protogynous</b> timing in these blossoms increased genetic diversity.</blockquote><blockquote>Many wrasse species are <b>protogynous</b>, with individuals changing from female to male as they grow.</blockquote><blockquote>In some coral reef fish, a <b>protogynous</b> life cycle helps maintain population balance.</blockquote><blockquote>Researchers observed that the <b>protogynous</b> group began as all females before some transitioned to males.</blockquote>
