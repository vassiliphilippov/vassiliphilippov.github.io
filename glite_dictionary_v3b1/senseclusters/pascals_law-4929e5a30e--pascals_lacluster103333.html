        <blockquote><b>Pascal's law</b> of pressure</blockquote><blockquote>According to <b>Pascal's law</b>, pressure in a fluid is transmitted equally in all directions.</blockquote><blockquote>Engineers rely on <b>Pascal's law</b> when designing equipment that uses fluid power.</blockquote><blockquote>Hydraulic systems such as car brakes operate based on <b>Pascal's law</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Engineers often use <b>Pascal's law</b> to design hydraulic systems in machinery and vehicles.</blockquote><blockquote>The hydraulic press operates according to <b>Pascal's law</b>, allowing a small input force to generate a large output force.</blockquote><blockquote>When you squeeze a tube of toothpaste, <b>Pascal's law</b> explains why the paste emerges evenly from the nozzle.</blockquote>
