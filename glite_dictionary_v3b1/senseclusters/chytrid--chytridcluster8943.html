        <blockquote>A <b>chytrid</b> fungus</blockquote><blockquote>Scientists discovered a new species of <b>chytrid</b> in the pond near the forest.</blockquote><blockquote>The decline in frog populations has been linked to a deadly <b>chytrid</b> infection.</blockquote><blockquote>Under the microscope, the <b>chytrid</b> releases its motile spores into the water.</blockquote><blockquote>Scientists discovered that the <b>chytrid</b> was responsible for the rapid decline in frog populations.</blockquote><blockquote>Efforts to control the spread of <b>chytrid</b> have become a major focus in amphibian conservation.</blockquote><blockquote>The presence of <b>chytrid</b> in the lake led to strict biosecurity measures for researchers.</blockquote><blockquote>The deadly <b>chytrid</b> fungus has caused a dramatic decline in frog populations worldwide.</blockquote><blockquote>Researchers are studying how <b>chytrid</b> infections spread among amphibians in the wild.</blockquote><blockquote>Conservationists are working to protect species threatened by the <b>chytrid</b> fungus.</blockquote>
