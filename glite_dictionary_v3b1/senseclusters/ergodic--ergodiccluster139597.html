        <blockquote>An <b>ergodic</b> process</blockquote><blockquote>In an <b>ergodic</b> process, the initial conditions become irrelevant as time progresses.</blockquote><blockquote>Researchers assume the climate model behaves in an <b>ergodic</b> manner for their simulations to be valid.</blockquote><blockquote>The system is said to be <b>ergodic</b> if its statistical properties are the same when measured over time as they are across the ensemble.</blockquote>
