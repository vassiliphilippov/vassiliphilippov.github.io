      <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3>
        <blockquote><b>Self-inductance</b> of coil</blockquote><blockquote>Engineers calculated the <b>self-inductance</b> to ensure the circuit operated safely.</blockquote><blockquote>Increasing the number of turns in a solenoid raises its <b>self-inductance</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>self-inductance</b> of the coil determines how much opposition it provides to a changing current.</blockquote>
