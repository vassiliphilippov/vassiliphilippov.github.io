                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Ledbetter' refers to a specific person (Huddie Ledbetter, also known as Lead Belly) and the synset is simply 'person'. Dictionary entries typically only include proper nouns for people when these names have a wider meaning, strong cultural significance, or are commonly used beyond just referencing the individual. 'Ledbetter' as a standalone entry would not typically appear in general dictionaries unless it has taken on a broader cultural or linguistic meaning, which it has not. Therefore, this concept is excluded.</p></div>
