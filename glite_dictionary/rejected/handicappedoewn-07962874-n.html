                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This synset refers to 'handicapped' as a collective term for people with disabilities, but the usage is outdated and potentially offensive. Modern dictionaries typically advise against its use as a noun to refer collectively to people and recommend 'people with disabilities' or 'disabled people' instead. The Oxford Dictionary marks 'handicapped' as offensive in this sense and does not list it as a currently acceptable noun for a group. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
