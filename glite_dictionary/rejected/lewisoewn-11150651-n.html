                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is a proper noun referring to a specific individual (John L. Lewis), but the headword 'Lewis' is too general for this biographical sense and would not appear alone in a dictionary for this meaning. Such entries are typically included under the full proper name, not just the surname, unless the surname itself has an established and distinguishable standalone usage unrelated to the person. Therefore, this concept is excluded.</p></div>
