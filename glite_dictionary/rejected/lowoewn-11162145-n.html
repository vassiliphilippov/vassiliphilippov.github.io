                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to the surname of a particular person (David Low, a cartoonist), but the synset is simply 'person' or 'proper noun,' which is too general. Surnames with only biographical senses are usually not included in general dictionaries like Oxford unless the person is extremely significant and their name has become a common word or eponym, which is not the case here. Therefore, this biographical entry is excluded.</p></div>
