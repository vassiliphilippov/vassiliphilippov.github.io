                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to John Harvard as 'Harvard', treating his surname as a standalone entry for the philanthropist. In English dictionaries, 'Harvard' as a headword refers to the university (proper noun), not the person. Biographical entries for surnames as headwords are typically limited to major historical figures where the surname universally refers to the person alone, which is not the case here. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a standalone dictionary entry.</p></div>
