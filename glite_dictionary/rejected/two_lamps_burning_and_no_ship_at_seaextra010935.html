                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'two lamps burning and no ship at sea' is not a recognized idiom or established phrase in English. It is not attested in major dictionaries like Oxford or in common usage. Its meaning is not clearly connected to the words themselves for most English speakers, and its usage appears extremely rare or idiosyncratic. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
