                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'in Switzerland' is not an idiom, phrasal verb, or established compound in English with the specialized sense of secret banking. In this context, it refers generally to Switzerland as a place associated with secretive banking, but does not constitute a dictionary-worthy set expression with a meaning separate from the sum of its parts. This sense is too context-dependent and not lexicalized enough for inclusion.</p></div>
