                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'withdraw into its carapace' is a descriptive, compositional phrase rather than a standard idiom or lexicalized term. It does not have a non-literal or figurative meaning beyond the straightforward action of a turtle retreating into its shell. This is not a set phrase or idiom that would appear as a headword in a dictionary like the Oxford Dictionary, but rather an expected combination of words.</p></div>
