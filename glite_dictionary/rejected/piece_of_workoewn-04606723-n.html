                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a very general sense of 'work' (product or result of an effort), but the headword is 'piece of work', which normally has a different and more specific idiomatic meaning in English (often a person who is unusual or difficult). The general 'product/accomplishment' sense forms core meanings of 'work', not 'piece of work', so this concept does not represent an actual phrase used in this sense in modern English. Therefore, it should not be included as an entry for 'piece of work'.</p></div>
