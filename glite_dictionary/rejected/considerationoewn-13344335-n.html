                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'consideration' as a fee charged in advance relates specifically to legal or commercial terminology, but is usually expressed with the term 'retainer' instead. The general dictionary entry for 'consideration' covers its main uses; this narrow fee-related meaning is rare in general English and is not commonly encountered outside legal jargon. Therefore, this particular concept is too specialized and overlaps with better-known terms, so it should not be included as a main dictionary entry for 'consideration.'</p></div>
