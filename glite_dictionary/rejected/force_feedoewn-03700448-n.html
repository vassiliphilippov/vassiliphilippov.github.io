                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept described is a particular technical sense of 'force feed' as a noun, specifically referring to a mechanical lubrication system, which is not in common standalone dictionary usage. Oxford Dictionary and similar references do not typically list 'force feed' as a noun for this meaning, but rather as a verb (to feed by force). The noun use for this engineering-specific mechanism is rare and too specialized, and is better covered within technical glossaries rather than a general English dictionary.</p></div>
