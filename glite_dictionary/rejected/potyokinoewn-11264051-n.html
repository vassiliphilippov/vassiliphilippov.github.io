                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The primary synset for 'Potyokin' here is simply 'person,' which is too general and not specific to the headword (it refers to the category of people rather than the individual or their historical significance). Dictionary entries for proper nouns should relate specifically to uniquely identifiable persons; however, this entry as defined refers only to the generic sense. If the reference had been to the historical figure Grigory Potemkin specifically, with a synset such as 'Russian officer and politician,' it would be included. As is, it is filtered out.</p></div>
