                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for '50000 Quaoar' is a planetoid discovered in 2002, which is appropriately specific and would be included in Oxford-like dictionaries as a proper noun for an astronomical object. However, as a number-designated astronomical object name, it functions as a proper noun and would not have a separate general meaning or sense suitable for an English dictionary entry beyond an encyclopedia. If the word is attested as a standalone proper noun with specialized information (as with Pluto or Ceres), it might warrant inclusion, but as written it is a scientific designation and more suitable for an encyclopedia, not a general dictionary.</p></div>
