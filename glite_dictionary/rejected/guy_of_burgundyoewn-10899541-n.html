                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a historical figure (Guy of Burgundy) but is too general, identifying him as simply a 'person.' Dictionary entries for people are included only when their significance is strongly tied to a specific name or term, not just any person. Additionally, most standard English dictionaries do not include minor historical figures unless their names are widely used as common nouns or adjectives, which is not the case here.</p></div>
