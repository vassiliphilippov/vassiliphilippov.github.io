                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described here refers to 'slow' meaning 'so lacking in interest as to cause mental weariness,' but this sense is better covered by adjectives such as 'boring,' 'dull,' 'tedious,' etc. The use of 'slow' in this way is not common, and established dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary do not mark 'slow' as standardly meaning 'boring' or 'tedious.' Therefore, this sense should not be included as an independent headword meaning in the dictionary.</p></div>
