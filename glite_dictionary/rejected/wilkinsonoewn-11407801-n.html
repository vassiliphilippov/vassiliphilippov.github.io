                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Wilkinson' in this context is simply 'person,' which is too general and does not provide a dictionary-worthy, specific entry. Dictionaries like Oxford only include proper nouns (such as notable people) when the person is extremely prominent and their name is used eponymously or with significant linguistic impact. 'Wilkinson' as a notable chemist does not meet this threshold for general dictionaries.</p></div>
