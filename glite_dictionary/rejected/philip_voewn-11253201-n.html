                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Philip V' is a proper noun referring to a specific historical figure, and its WordNet sense is 'king of ancient Macedonia,' which is a general label for a person, not a distinct lexical concept. Proper names of historical figures are usually not included as headwords in general English dictionaries like Oxford, unless they have become words or idioms in English or have secondary meanings. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
