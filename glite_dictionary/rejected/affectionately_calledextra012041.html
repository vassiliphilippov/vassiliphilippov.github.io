                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'affectionately called' is a compositional and transparent phrase formed from the adverb 'affectionately' and the past participle 'called', meaning 'called with affection.' This is not an idiomatic, lexicalized, or fixed expression that warrants a standalone entry in an English-English dictionary, as it follows directly from its constituent words. Such participial/adverbial phrases are not typically included unless they have acquired a distinctive, fixed meaning beyond the sum of their parts.</p></div>
