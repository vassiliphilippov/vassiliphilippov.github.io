                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'Alice Walker' is a well-known writer, the WordNet sense provided ('person') is too general and refers only to her status as a human being, not as a notable individual with specific achievements. Dictionary entries for people typically require a more descriptive sense (e.g., 'American author and activist known for The Color Purple'), and dictionary coverage is usually limited to words, not specific people unless of enduring cultural impact. Proper nouns referring to individuals are usually not included unless they are eponymous or of exceptional historical importance. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
