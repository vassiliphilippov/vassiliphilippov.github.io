                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'so' as an adverb meaning 'in a manner that facilitates' is too general and does not relate directly to a specific, dictionary-worthy sense distinct from its primary usage as an adverb, conjunction, or interjection. The example sentences actually use 'so' as a conjunction ('so that'), not as an independent adverb. This meaning would not be included as a separate entry in a standard dictionary like Oxford. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
