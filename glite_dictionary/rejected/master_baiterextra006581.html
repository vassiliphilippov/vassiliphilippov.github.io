                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although the term 'master baiter' is believable as a playful or punning compound (and appears in jokes due to its phonetic similarity to 'masturbator'), it is not a standard dictionary entry in the sense of Oxford or other major referenced dictionaries for the meaning 'expert in fishing.' It is not commonly or seriously used as a professional or technical term in fishing and does not meet the threshold for dictionary inclusion.</p></div>
