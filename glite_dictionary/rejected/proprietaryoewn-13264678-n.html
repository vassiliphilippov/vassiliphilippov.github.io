                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described here refers to a business entity type (sole proprietorship), but the word 'proprietary' as a noun in this context is not standard or widely used in English. In dictionaries like Oxford, the noun 'proprietorship' or the phrase 'sole proprietorship' appear, not 'proprietary' as the headword with this meaning. Therefore, this concept does not warrant a standalone dictionary entry for 'proprietary' as a noun meaning an unincorporated business owned by one person.</p></div>
