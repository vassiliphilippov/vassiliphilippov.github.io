                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is 'Roman statesman and orator,' which is a general category not specifically connected to 'Cicero' as a unique lexical item. Proper names referring to historical persons are usually included only if their name has acquired significant secondary meaning in English, or the person is of major significance. While Cicero is notable, as a proper noun denoting a specific individual, it would not typically receive a standalone dictionary entry unless it also carries other lexical meanings (e.g., as a symbol or term in English). In this context, the word refers simply to the person and is not a general lexical concept.</p></div>
