                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Department of Energy Intelligence' refers to an agency but its synset is just 'agency', which is too general and not specific to the term itself. Such a generic sense should not be included as a dictionary entry. Only specialized terms with distinct meanings or roles beyond their general category are included.</p></div>
