                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'challenges of incumbency' is a descriptive noun phrase, not an established set phrase or idiom recognized as a lexical item in major dictionaries. It is composed of the common noun 'challenges' and the noun 'incumbency,' both of which have their own entries. This phrase does not carry a special or fixed meaning beyond its parts and would not be included as a headword in a dictionary like Oxford.</p></div>
