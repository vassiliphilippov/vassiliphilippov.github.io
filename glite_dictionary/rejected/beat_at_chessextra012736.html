                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'beat at chess' is a compositional, transparent phrase made up of the verb 'beat' in the sense of 'defeat' and the prepositional phrase 'at chess.' It does not have a non-obvious or idiomatic meaning beyond 'to win a chess game against someone.' This is not a fixed phrase or an idiom that would appear as a headword in a dictionary like Oxford. Dictionary entries would include 'beat' with meanings relevant to games, and possibly 'beat at' as a phrasal verb, but not 'beat at chess' as its own entry.</p></div>
