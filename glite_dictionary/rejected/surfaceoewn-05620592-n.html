                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'surface' as 'information that has become public' is too semantically broad and not a standard usage. 'Surface' is not used as a noun in standard English to mean 'publicly known information'â€”rather, 'to surface' as a verb can mean 'to become known.' However, this noun usage does not have established dictionary presence and would not appear as a distinct noun sense in major dictionaries.</p></div>
