                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The given synset ('a small but violent terrorist organization formed in Ecuador in the early 1990s; responsible for bombing several government buildings') describes an entity that is too specialized and context-specific for a general-purpose English dictionary. Additionally, the headword 'Communist Party of Ecuador' commonly refers to a political party, not this specific terrorist organization. The synset is not specific to the headword and is too general to include as a dictionary entry per guidelines.</p></div>
