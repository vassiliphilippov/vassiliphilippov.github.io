                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'called a coon' here refers to a specific nickname or affectionate term in a private or extremely restricted social context, not a widely recognized term of endearment or nickname in general English. Additionally, 'coon' is primarily known as an extremely offensive racial slur; its use as an endearment is not standard, is contextually problematic, and is not current or established enough to warrant a dictionary entry as an endearing sense. Thus, this concept should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
