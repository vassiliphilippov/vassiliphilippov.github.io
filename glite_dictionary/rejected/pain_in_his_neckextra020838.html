                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'pain in his neck' is a generic phrase composed of common words and does not represent a fixed expression, idiom, or lexicalized compound. It refers to a literal pain in the neck area, which is covered under 'pain' or 'neck pain'. Thus, it would not appear as a headword in a dictionary like the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
