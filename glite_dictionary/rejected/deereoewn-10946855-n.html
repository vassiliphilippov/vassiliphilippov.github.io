                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Deere' is simply 'person,' which is too general and does not provide a distinctive definition beyond being a person's surname. Dictionary entries for proper nouns like this are typically reserved for widely known historical or cultural figures, and are usually labeled as 'biographical' or 'proper noun' entries. Here, the lemma refers to John Deere, the industrialist, but as written, 'Deere' alone in general reference to a person would not be included as a full entry in a standard dictionary like Oxford without additional context.</p></div>
