                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>'john school' as described does not have a recognized widespread meaning in English equivalent to 'a school focused on sexual education or informal education for young children.' It does not appear in major dictionaries with this definition, and in common usage, 'john school' is a slang term referring to educational programs for people arrested for soliciting sex workers. Therefore, this sense is either too obscure or incorrectly defined for inclusion in a general dictionary.</p></div>
