                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Anthony' here refers generically to a person (specifically Marcus Antonius), but as a proper noun for a historical figure, it is not included as a general English dictionary entry; it would be more appropriate for an encyclopedia or biographical dictionary. Standard dictionaries such as Oxford do not typically include proper names of historical persons unless their name has developed a secondary, non-person meaning.</p></div>
