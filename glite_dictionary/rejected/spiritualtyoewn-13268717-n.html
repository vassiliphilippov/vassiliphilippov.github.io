                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'spiritualty' here refers specifically to property or income owned by a church. While it is a rare and historical term, it is distinct from the general sense of 'spirituality' (the quality of being concerned with the human spirit). The term 'spiritualty' in this sense is very archaic, seldom used, and mostly appears in legal or ecclesiastical contexts. Because it would be found in historical texts and has a specialized meaning, it may be included in an unabridged or historical dictionary, but would be excluded from a general-purpose dictionary today due to extreme rarity.</p></div>
