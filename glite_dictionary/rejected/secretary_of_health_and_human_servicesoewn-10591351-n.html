                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Secretary of Health and Human Services' refers to a specific officeholder whose synset is essentially 'person,' which is too general and not directly tied to the meaning of the headword. Dictionary entries typically do not include officeholders as a class but focus on the office or title itself. The sense given is not meaningfully distinct from 'person holding any official office,' so it does not belong as a headword-worthy entry.</p></div>
