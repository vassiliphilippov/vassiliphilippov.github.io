                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'no more' in this synset sense means 'not now' (specifically, 'she is no more' meaning 'she is dead'). However, this is a fixed, somewhat archaic use occurring mainly in literary or poetic contexts as an elliptical form of 'is no more.' Because it is not a general adverb or independently used expression, but rather a phrase occurring almost exclusively as a predicate about someone's existence, it does not merit a separate dictionary entry under 'no more' as an adverb meaning 'not now.' Instead, dictionary entries typically capture 'no more' as 'not any longer' or as part of set idiomatic expressions. Thus, this sense should be excluded as too restricted and literary, not matching what would appear as an independent main entry in a learner's dictionary.</p></div>
