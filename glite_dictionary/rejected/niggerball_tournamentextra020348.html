                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept uses an extremely offensive, racist term which is not appropriate for inclusion in a modern English-English dictionary, except perhaps as a historical citation with great caution. Such terminology is no longer in use outside of referencing racism itself. Including it would violate standards of responsible lexicography and is not in line with Oxford Dictionary policy unless treated as a historical slur in a very controlled, explanatory context, which is not the case here.</p></div>
