Biographical entries of this kind are not included in standard English-English dictionaries unless the person is overwhelmingly notable and the dictionary regularly includes major historical figures; however, most dictionaries do not include individual names of scientists unless they are eponymous or used as common words. As per the provided criteria, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
