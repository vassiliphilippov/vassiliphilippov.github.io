                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'cockbreath attitude' is not a standard entry in English dictionaries and does not have independent lexical standing beyond being a vulgar, ephemeral insult. The phrase combines vulgar slang as an adjective with a common noun. Such ad hoc, compound insults are generally not included unless they are widespread, established, and independently notable, which this is not. The synset is not sufficiently specific or distinct from its components, nor does it represent a standard phrase or idiom found in reputable dictionaries.</p></div>
