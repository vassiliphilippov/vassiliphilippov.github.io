                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'capable of causing burns' with the synset's POS 'r' (adverb) is not an independent word/phrase that would appear as an entry in a dictionary. It is instead an adjectival or participial use; 'scorching' is commonly listed as an adjective and sometimes as a present participle. As 'scorching' (adverb) meaning 'in a way capable of causing burns' does not exist as a separate dictionary entry, and the adverbial sense is not distinct or in use, this specific concept should not be included as its own entry. The adjective 'scorching' would be included in the dictionary, but not this adverbial sense.</p></div>
