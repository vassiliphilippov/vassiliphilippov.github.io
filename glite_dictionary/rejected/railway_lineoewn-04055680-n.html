                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described refers to 'railway line' as a commercial organization responsible for operating train transport, which is not the most common or standard meaning of 'railway line'. That sense is too general and overlaps with 'organization' in WordNet, and such a specific organizational sense for 'railway line' is not standard in major dictionaries; 'railway' or 'railway company' is standard for that sense. The typical meaning of 'railway line' is the set of tracks, not the organization, so this particular concept should be excluded.</p></div>
