                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here relates to the proper name 'Simpson' as a person (James Young Simpson), with the synset essentially being 'person'. Dictionary entries for proper nouns relating to individuals are only included when they represent unique individuals notable enough to merit biographical entries. However, general English dictionaries (such as the Oxford Dictionary) typically do not include proper noun entries for people unless their names are also used for something else (e.g., 'sandwich', 'diesel') or they have become common nouns. Therefore, this concept does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
