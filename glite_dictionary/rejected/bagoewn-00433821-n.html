                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to a sense of 'bag' as an activity or interest, but this figurative use (meaning 'specialty, area of interest or expertise') is now rare and chiefly historical or slang, not widely encountered in contemporary English. Standard dictionaries sometimes list it as slang but note it's dated. The phrase is more commonly encountered as 'not my bag' rather than as 'bag' alone. For clarity and dictionary relevance, and since this use is extremely uncommon today, it should be excluded.</p></div>
