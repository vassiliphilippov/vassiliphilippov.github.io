                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'comfort girl' here refers simply to a girl providing emotional support, which is too general and does not represent a commonly recognized term with an independent entry in standard English dictionaries such as Oxford. Additionally, 'comfort girl' is far more widely known as an offensive historical euphemism for women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military in WWII, but that meaning is not the one in this synset. The generic meaning given here is not dictionary-worthy as a separate entry.</p></div>
