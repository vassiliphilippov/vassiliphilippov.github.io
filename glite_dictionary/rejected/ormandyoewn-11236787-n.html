                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Ormandy' here is simply 'person', which is too general. Although Ormandy refers specifically to Eugene Ormandy, a famous conductor, the concept as presented does not include a more specific synset or sense definition; it's just an instance of a person. Dictionary entries for proper nouns like this are only included when the specific person is historically or culturally significant and the entry is about the individual and their achievements, not just the general category of 'person'. Since the synset is too general, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
