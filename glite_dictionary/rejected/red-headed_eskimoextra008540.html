                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'red-headed Eskimo' is a specific phrase describing a person of Inuit descent with red hair, often referenced in folklore. However, it is not an established term with independent dictionary status and simply refers to a descriptive category rather than a recognized expression or compound. Furthermore, 'Eskimo' is considered outdated and potentially offensive; modern dictionaries favor 'Inuit' or specific group names. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a standalone entry.</p></div>
