                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although the phrase 'homonazi tactic' is attested in some speech and writing, it is a very rare, explicitly derogatory and offensive neologism, primarily occurring online to insult LGBTQ+ activists. It does not have widespread, well-documented usage, and its construction is sensational and designed to provoke. Such a term would not be included in a standard dictionary like Oxford, as it is not established, is extremely offensive, and not instructive outside monitoring hate speech.</p></div>
