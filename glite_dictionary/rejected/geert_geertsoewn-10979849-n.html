                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Geert Geerts' refers to a specific historical person (also known as Erasmus), and its synset is essentially 'person' rather than a unique, dictionary-worthy term or phrase. Personal names of this specificity are typically not included in standard English dictionaries unless the name itself has acquired a meaning beyond the person.</p></div>
