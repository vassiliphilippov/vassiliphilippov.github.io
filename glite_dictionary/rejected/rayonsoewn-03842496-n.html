                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'rayons' as described (women's stockings made from sheer material) is highly obscure and not in common or even niche usage in English, and is effectively archaic or obsolete. The word 'rayon' itself is included as a material, but 'rayons' as a term specifically meaning women's stockings does not meet dictionary inclusion standards for modern usage. It would not appear as a headword or main sense in reputable dictionaries such as the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
