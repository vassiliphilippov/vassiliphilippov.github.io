                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This synset refers to a very specific and technical horticultural process (to deaden a plant by girdling), but 'deaden' is not commonly used with this sense outside very technical texts. Furthermore, this meaning is a particular application of the general verb 'deaden,' which means to make something less alive or active, not a distinct dictionary-worthy sense. The general meanings of 'deaden' (to make dull, less lively, or less intense) deserve inclusion, but this highly specific use, as defined here, would not typically have its own entry or subsense in major English dictionaries, such as the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
