                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'fathom the complexity' is a compositional phrase made up of the verb 'fathom' and the noun phrase 'the complexity.' Since 'fathom' meaning 'to understand deeply' and 'complexity' meaning 'the state of being intricate or complicated' are already covered as dictionary entries, this specific phrase does not have a unique idiomatic, set, or non-compositional meaning that would require its own entry. It would not appear as a headword in standard dictionaries such as Oxford.</p></div>
