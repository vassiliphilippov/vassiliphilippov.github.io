                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'lawyer foyer' is a descriptive noun phrase referring generally to a type of waiting area in a law office, not a standard lexicalized term or fixed phrase that would be included in a dictionary such as Oxford. It is not a compound or established collocation, but rather a compositional phrase.</p></div>
