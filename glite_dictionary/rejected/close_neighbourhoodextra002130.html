                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'close neighbourhood' is not a standard or established compound or idiom in English. It is a compositional phrase that does not have an idiomatic or distinct meaning beyond its literal words, and such usages would not typically appear as dictionary entries in reputable English dictionaries like Oxford. Standard expressions include 'nearby', 'close proximity', or simply 'neighbourhood'.</p></div>
