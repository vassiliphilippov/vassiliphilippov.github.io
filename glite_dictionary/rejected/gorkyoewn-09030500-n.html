                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Gorky' as 'an industrial city in the European part of Russia' refers to the city now officially called Nizhny Novgorod; its usage as 'Gorky' is outdated and unlikely to appear outside historical or specialized contexts. As a proper noun for a place, unless it has current and significant usage or specific meaning distinct from its modern name, it would not be included in a general English dictionary. The synset is also too general (it maps to a place name, which are not typically included unless exceptionally relevant in English).</p></div>
