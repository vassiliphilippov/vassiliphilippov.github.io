                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset describes Claes Thure Oldenburg as an instance of a person, specifically an individual artist. Proper names referring to individual people, unless extremely famous or with unique, commonly used lexical meanings, are generally not included in standard English dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary. Therefore, this concept does not meet inclusion criteria.</p></div>
