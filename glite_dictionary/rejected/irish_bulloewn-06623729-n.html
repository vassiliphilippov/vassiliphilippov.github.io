                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset provided for 'Irish bull' is actually referring to the general slang use of 'bull' as an obscene or informal term for nonsense or unacceptable behavior, not to the specific idiom 'Irish bull' (which means a statement that is seemingly contradictory or absurd, often unintentionally humorous). The given definition and examples are for the general slang usage of 'bull' (as in 'bullshit'), not for 'Irish bull' as an independent entry. Therefore, this concept should be excluded as its synset is too general and not specific to the headword 'Irish bull.'</p></div>
