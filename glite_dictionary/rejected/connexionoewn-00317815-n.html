                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense described is actually for "connection" in the meaning of a transfer from one form of transportation to another. "Connexion" is an alternative (chiefly British, now rare) spelling of "connection." The sense is not unique to "connexion," and "connexion" itself is rarely used in modern English except as an archaic or variant spelling. In addition, dictionaries such as Oxford typically list "connexion" only as a variant spelling of "connection," not as a separate headword with its unique sense. Therefore, it should not be included as a standalone entry for this meaning.</p></div>
