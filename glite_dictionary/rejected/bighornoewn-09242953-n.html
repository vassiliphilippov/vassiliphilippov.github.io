                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Bighorn' is a toponym referring to a specific river, which would only be included in a general English dictionary if it were a widely significant geographic feature or commonly referenced term. Most general dictionaries do not include lesser-known place names unless they have broader linguistic or cultural significance. Therefore, this concept is filtered out as too specific and not directly related to the general headword as commonly included in dictionaries.</p></div>
