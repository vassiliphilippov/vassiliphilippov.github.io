                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'defenseless' with the adverbial synset (defenselessly) is an adverbial form, but the headword requested is 'defenseless', which is standardly an adjective. The adverb 'defenselessly' appears in dictionaries as a derived adverb from 'defenseless', but the exact synset here is for the adverb and does not merit a standalone entry for 'defenseless' as an adverb itself. The adjective 'defenseless' would be included, but this particular synset is the adverbial sense. Thus, exclude this adverbial concept as it is not a primary headword.</p></div>
