                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset "basketweaving skill" is a phrase composed of "basketweaving" and "skill"; it is a compositional, transparent phrase rather than a fixed, idiomatic, or specialized term. Such noun phrases are typically not included in dictionaries unless they have a distinct meaning unrelated to their parts. In this case, it refers simply to the skill of basketweaving, which can be found under "basketweaving" or "basket weaving" as a noun.</p></div>
