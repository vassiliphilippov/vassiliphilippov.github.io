                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'thick and threefold' is not widely recognized as a standard idiom, fixed expression, or dictionary-worthy phrase in English. It is not commonly found in major dictionaries and appears to be a rare or creative expression, rather than an established term. Its inclusion would not be appropriate for a general English dictionary modeled on Oxford standards.</p></div>
