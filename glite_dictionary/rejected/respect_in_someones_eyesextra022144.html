                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'respect in someone's eyes' with this synset is a compositional phrase that is transparent in meaning (i.e., 'respect' as perceived through someone's gaze), and does not constitute a set phrase, idiom, or distinctive compound outside of general syntactic usage. Such phrases are not included as headwords in major dictionaries such as Oxford, as they are not fixed expressions or idioms with non-obvious meaning.</p></div>
