                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although Ivan Lendl is a notable individual, this concept represents a proper noun (the name of a person) whose synset is simply 'person' or 'tennis player.' English dictionaries such as Oxford typically only include proper nouns for highly prominent historical, literary, or mythological figures, or when the term is also used attributively. Otherwise, proper names with generic synsets like 'person' are excluded.</p></div>
