                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described here is the general concept of 'period during which something is functional,' which is usually covered under the main entry for 'life' rather than a distinct entry for 'life-time' (which is an uncommon spelling; the standard form is 'lifetime'). Thus, the concept as given is too general and does not warrant a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
