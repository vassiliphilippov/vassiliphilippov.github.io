                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Richard II' here is essentially 'person', which is too general and applies to any individual. As such, this entry does not meet the criterion for inclusion as a dictionary entry, which should only include proper noun concepts if they represent a unique, historically or culturally significant entity with a specialized meaning. Here, the sense is merely biographical.</p></div>
