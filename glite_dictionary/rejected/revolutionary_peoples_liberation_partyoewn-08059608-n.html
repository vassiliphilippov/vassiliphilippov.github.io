                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a specific organization but is overly general because the main sense is 'organization' and not a unique, established term or name as would be found in most dictionaries. Names of specific insurgent groups are typically not included unless they have broad historical or global significance and are treated as proper nouns with unique significance (e.g., 'IRA', 'Al-Qaeda'). This group does not meet that threshold for general English dictionaries such as Oxford.</p></div>
