While proper names of highly notable historical figures are sometimes included in larger encyclopedias, they are generally not included in standard English-English dictionaries unless their names have developed an additional, non-proper meaning (e.g., 'Machiavellian' from Machiavelli). Therefore, this concept does not fit standard dictionary criteria and should not be included.</p></div>
