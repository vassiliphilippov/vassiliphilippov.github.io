                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'adjective pronoun' refers to a grammatical term describing a pronoun acting as an adjective. While it is a real term in grammar, it is highly technical, archaic in traditional English grammar, and not commonly featured as a distinct entry in modern general English dictionaries like Oxford. Furthermore, the term is usually subsumed under broader terms like 'pronominal adjective' or simply explained in language grammar guides under determiners or relative/interrogative pronouns, rather than being a dictionary headword. Therefore, it does not meet the inclusion criteria for a general dictionary.</p></div>
