                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is simply 'person' and refers to a full personal name (Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim), which is typically included only as a biographical entry, not as a dictionary word. Standard dictionaries like Oxford do not include most full historical personal names as headwords unless they are extremely common or have acquired additional non-person meanings.</p></div>
