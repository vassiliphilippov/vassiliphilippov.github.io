                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept "being seen as a rube" is a specific phrase describing a state (being perceived as unsophisticated) rather than an established phrase, idiom, or fixed expression found in dictionaries. It is simply a compositional usage of the word "rube." The word "rube" itself would be appropriate for a dictionary entry, but the phrase is too specific and not dictionary material.</p></div>
