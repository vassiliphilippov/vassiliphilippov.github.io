                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is correctly associated with the headword 'Joseph Pulitzer,' a notable historical figure, and such proper names of famous individuals are commonly included in major English dictionaries like Oxford. However, if the synset were only labeled generally as 'person,' it should be excluded. In this case, the sense is specific, so it would typically be included. But following the instructions, which mention inclusion for things that would appear in the Oxford Dictionary, this is an acceptable entry, so contrary to the confusion, it should be included.</p></div>
