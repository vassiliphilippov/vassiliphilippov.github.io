                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This synset of 'impulsive' refers to 'having the power of driving or impelling,' which is both highly technical and is not a primary, familiar sense of the word in general English. In this sense, it is typically covered by adjectives like 'driving' or 'impelling' and is not a standard meaning found in major dictionaries. The well-known sense of 'impulsive' is 'acting or done without forethought,' which is included in all dictionaries. Therefore, this particular technical sense should be excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
