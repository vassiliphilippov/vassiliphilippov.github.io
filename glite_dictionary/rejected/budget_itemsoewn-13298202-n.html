                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'budget items' in this sense refers specifically to components of a budget related to property maintenance expenses, but the phrase itself is too broad and general (referring to any items in a budget) to warrant a dedicated entry for this particular sense. This specific use would more likely appear under specialized financial terms such as 'operating expenses' or 'maintenance expenses', not as its own general dictionary entry. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a headword in a general English dictionary.</p></div>
