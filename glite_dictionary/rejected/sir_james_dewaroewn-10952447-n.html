                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Sir James Dewar' is 'person', which is too general and refers to an individual. Dictionary entries for proper nouns are limited to words with meaning beyond simply naming a person, such as those whose names have become terms (e.g., 'dewar flask'), not just biographical entries. Such entries would not typically be included in a standard English-English dictionary like Oxford unless the person's name has acquired specific additional meaning or significance.</p></div>
