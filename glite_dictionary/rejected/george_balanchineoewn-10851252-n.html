                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to a specific person and the synset is a proper noun ('person, dancer, choreographer'), which is too general. Such biographical entries (specific individuals) are generally not included in standard English dictionaries like Oxford, unless the person is of very exceptional and enduring historical/cultural significance. Even so, most dictionaries do not include entries for historic figures except in compact encyclopedic formats. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
