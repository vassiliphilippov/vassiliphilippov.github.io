                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'fighting little judge' is not a widely recognized idiom, set phrase, or compound that would appear as a dictionary headword in resources like Oxford Dictionary; rather, it is a descriptive phrase referring to an individual. Its synset does not reflect a fixed lexicalized meaning but rather a specific descriptive use.</p></div>
