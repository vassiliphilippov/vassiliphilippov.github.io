                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset meaning is about the act of naming or assigning a name, which properly relates to verbs such as 'name' or 'call', not the phrase 'be known as'. 'Be known as' is not properly used for the act of naming but rather being recognized or referred to by a certain name. The provided examples better fit 'name' as a verb. Therefore, this specific concept ('be known as' meaning 'to assign a name to') should be excluded, as it's not a conventional dictionary entry for this meaning.</p></div>
