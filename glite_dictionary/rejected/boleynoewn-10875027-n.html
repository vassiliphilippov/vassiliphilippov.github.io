                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here ('person') is too general for inclusion. While Anne Boleyn is a specific historical figure and likely her full name would be included, the lemma 'Boleyn' alone is treated as a surname and the concept as presented is not specific to the common noun or proper noun sense suitable for a dictionary entry. The entry refers to a person with only their surname, which is too broad and general as per the filtering guidelines.</p></div>
