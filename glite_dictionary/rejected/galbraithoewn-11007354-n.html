                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is 'person' relating to the proper noun 'Galbraith' as a particular individual, not as a lexical word with lexical meaning or usage. Proper names of individuals, such as 'Galbraith', are generally not included in standard dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary unless they have a secondary meaning or are extremely culturally significant (and in that case, would be given a description relevant to lexicon, not just a biographical note). Therefore, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
