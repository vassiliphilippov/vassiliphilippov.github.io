                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Jonson' is a general proper noun denoting a person (specifically Ben Jonson), which by itself as a surname or as a proper noun is generally excluded in standard English dictionaries (except large encyclopedias or biographical dictionaries) unless the individual is exceptionally notable and the surname has acquired an additional sense or usage. Standard monolingual dictionaries like Oxford do not normally include single biographical entries for surnames unless they have distinct word-level senses; thus, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
