                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'all' as a degree adverb meaning 'completely' or 'entirely' is rarely used and is not standard in modern English general usage. In contemporary dictionaries like Oxford, this adverbial sense does not warrant a separate entry because its usage is limited and mainly dialectal or idiomatic. The headword 'all' more commonly appears as a determiner, pronoun, or noun. The standard adverbs expressing this sense are 'wholly', 'completely', 'totally', or 'entirely'. Therefore, this synset should be excluded.</p></div>
