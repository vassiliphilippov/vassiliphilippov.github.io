                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Olympian in swimming' is a very specific usage of 'Olympian' applied to a particular sport (swimming). The general meaning 'Olympian' (a competitor in the Olympic Games) should be included instead; sport-specific variants of the term like this are not dictionary headwords and would not appear as their own entry in major dictionaries such as Oxford.</p></div>
