                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to the general sense of a 'setting in which something can be displayed to best effect,' exemplified by 'showcase.' However, 'show window' in current standard usage refers specifically to the glass-fronted display window of a shop and is not commonly used in the figurative, broader sense described here. The sense here is better covered by 'showcase,' and this figurative usage of 'show window' would not appear as its own entry in Oxford or similar dictionaries. Therefore, it should not be included as a separate concept.</p></div>
