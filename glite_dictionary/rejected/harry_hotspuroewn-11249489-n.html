                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Harry Hotspur' is simply 'person', which is too general and does not provide a specific sense of notability beyond being a proper name for a historical figure. Oxford Dictionary would only include this if the individual is extremely culturally significant and their name is used as a regular noun or in set phrases (e.g., 'a hotspur' meaning a rash or impetuous person, which is derived from him), rather than as an encyclopedic entry. Since this specific concept is not distinct from 'person', it should be excluded.</p></div>
