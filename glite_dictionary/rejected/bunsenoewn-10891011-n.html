                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Bunsen' is tied to 'person', which is too general and refers to the individual's identity as a person. While Robert Bunsen is a notable figure, standard English dictionaries do not include personal names unless they have a clearly distinct meaning as common nouns or adjectives (such as 'Bunsen burner'). Therefore, this concept should not be included as a dictionary entry for an English-English dictionary.</p></div>
