                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described here is 'amass so as to keep for future use', which is commonly expressed as 'stock' or 'stock up' rather than 'buy in'. The phrase 'buy in' in English dictionaries typically does not convey this precise meaning; instead, it more commonly refers to purchasing a stake, as in business or finance, or 'buying into' an idea. Therefore, this particular concept is too generic and not properly linked to the phrasal verb 'buy in' as it would appear in a standard English dictionary. It should be excluded.</p></div>
