                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept's synset is not directly related to the headword but is an offensive phrase formed by adding a racial slur to a general term. Dictionaries of reputable standards do not include entries for every possible offensive or derogatory phrase constructed in this manner, especially when it is not widely attested as a distinct lexicalized expression. The phrase is simply a combination of a highly offensive slur and a generic noun, and is not a specific, established term deserving of an entry. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
