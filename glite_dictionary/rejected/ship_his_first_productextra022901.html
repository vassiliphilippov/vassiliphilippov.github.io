                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept "ship his first product" is a specific verbal phrase based on the general verb "ship" in its meaning of 'send goods to customers'. The phrase is compositional: 'to ship' + 'his first product'. Dictionaries typically include 'ship' as a verb with the meaning of sending products, but not every possible modification (such as 'ship his first product'). This is not an idiom or lexicalized phrase, nor does it have a special meaning beyond that of 'ship' and 'first product' individually. Therefore, this specific phrase does not warrant an entry in a dictionary.</p></div>
