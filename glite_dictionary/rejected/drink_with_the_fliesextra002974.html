                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'drink with the flies' is not widely recognized as a standard idiom or set phrase in English, nor is it found in major dictionaries. Its meaning appears highly obscure or possibly regional/slang, and it does not have sufficient established usage to warrant inclusion in a general English dictionary like Oxford. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
