                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here defines 'Education' as a specific U.S. federal department, which is a particular organization, not a general meaning for the word 'education.' Proper nouns for government organizations are not included unless they are universally recognized and lexicalized, which 'the United States Department of Education' is not as 'Education.' This concept is too specific and organizational to warrant a general dictionary entry under the headword 'education.'</p></div>
