                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept is a biographical entry where the synset is merely 'person.' The specific information about Stephen A. Douglas can be included in a biographical encyclopedia, but the concept does not represent a sense or usage of 'Stephen A. Douglas' beyond being a specific person's name. Names that are only categorized as 'person' in WordNet are typically not included in general dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary, unless they have become common nouns or have special meanings beyond being a personal name.</p></div>
