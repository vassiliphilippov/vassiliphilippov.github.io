                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to Jules de Goncourt, identified solely by his surname 'Goncourt' and described as a French writer and brother of Edmond de Goncourt. While 'Goncourt' is a legitimate surname, as a dictionary headword on its own, with this general sense ('French writer'), it is too broad and refers to a specific person classified generically ('writer'), which falls under the rule to exclude concepts where the synset is not specifically related to the headword or is overly general (e.g., 'person'). Therefore, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
