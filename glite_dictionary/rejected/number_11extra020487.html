                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'number 11' as a specific player identified by their jersey number refers to an individual label rather than a general dictionary entry. This is a context-specific useâ€”not a general word or phrase, nor a fixed term with independent meaning outside sports rosters. Such usages are generally not included in major English dictionaries like Oxford.</p></div>
