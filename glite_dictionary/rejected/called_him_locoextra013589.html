                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'called him loco' is a phrase based on the Spanish word 'loco' meaning 'crazy', and the synset is essentially the phrase 'crazy or foolish'. The expression itself ('called him loco') is not a set phrase or idiom in standard English, nor would it appear as an entry in a dictionary like Oxford; instead, 'loco' as an adjective meaning 'crazy' could be included. Therefore, this phrase does not qualify as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
