                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense describes 'destination' as referring specifically to written directions or the address on mail or packages, which is not a common or standard usage separate from its main sense ('the place to which someone or something is going or being sent'). Dictionaries typically only include the destination as the place itself, not as the writing or address, so this concept is too specialized and should not be included as a separate entry.</p></div>
