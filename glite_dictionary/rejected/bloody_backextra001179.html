                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'bloody back' is simply a compositional phrase made from the adjective 'bloody' and the noun 'back,' meaning a back that is bleeding or has blood on it. It is not a set expression, an idiom, or a commonly recognized compound; rather, it is a literal, descriptive phrase. As such, it would not appear as its own entry in a dictionary like Oxford, since its meaning is transparent from its parts.</p></div>
