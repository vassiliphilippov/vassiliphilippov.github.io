Such proper noun entries about individuals whose notability is scientific but whose names have not become words in their own right are generally not included in English-English dictionaries like Oxford unless their name has taken on an additional sense or their achievements are referenced directly through their name. This is best handled in an encyclopedia, not a standard dictionary.</p></div>
