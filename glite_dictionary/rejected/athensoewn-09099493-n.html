                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'Athens' refers to a specific location categorized as a 'university town' in Georgia, USA. However, as a dictionary entry, 'Athens' as a place name would be included under its primary sense (the city in Greece), or possibly as a proper noun listing with other locations as subsidiary senses. The synset here is merely 'location' or 'place', and does not provide a distinct lexical sense justifying a separate dictionary entry for 'Athens' (the town in Georgia) within a standard English dictionary. Such entries of all place names are typically out of scope unless the place is lexically significant.</p></div>
