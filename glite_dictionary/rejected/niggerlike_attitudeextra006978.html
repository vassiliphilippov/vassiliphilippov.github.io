                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This term is overtly offensive and derived from a racial slur. Dictionary standards, including Oxford and other major dictionaries, do not include offensive formations based on slurs unless they have substantial independent usage or relevance, which this term does not. Its inclusion would be inappropriate, and it is not a commonly used or independently notable expression. Therefore, it should be excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
