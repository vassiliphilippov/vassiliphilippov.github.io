                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'worship as a deity' refers to the general idea of being revered as a god, not a specific dictionary entry or fixed expression. It does not correspond to an established headword or set phrase that would appear in Oxford Dictionaryâ€”it's simply a descriptive phrase. Therefore, it should not be included as its own entry.</p></div>
