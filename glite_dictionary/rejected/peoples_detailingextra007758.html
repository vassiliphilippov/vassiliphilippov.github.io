                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'people's detailing' is a phrase found in context, but it is not a standard compound or set phrase in English. Its meaning is compositional and context-specific rather than having a fixed or dictionary-worthy sense. The synset is not sufficiently tied to a unique, idiomatic, or established use that requires a dictionary entry. The meaning can be understood from the component words 'people' and 'detailing,' so this would not appear as a separate entry in Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
