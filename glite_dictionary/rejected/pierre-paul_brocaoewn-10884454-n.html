                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Pierre-Paul Broca' corresponds to 'person', which is too general and does not warrant a dedicated dictionary entry. Biographical entries for individuals of this type are not typically included in standard English dictionaries unless their names have also become common nouns or adjectives (e.g. 'Broca's area'), which is not the case here.</p></div>
