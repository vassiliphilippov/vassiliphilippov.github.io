                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to 'Fuchs' as a person, specifically Klaus Fuchs. In standard English dictionaries like Oxford, only highly prominent proper nouns are included, typically as encyclopedic entries. As a personal name, it falls outside the scope of standard dictionary headwords and would be more appropriate in a biographical encyclopedia. Thus, this concept should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
