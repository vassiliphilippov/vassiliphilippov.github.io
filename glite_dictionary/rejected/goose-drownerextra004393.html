                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'goose-drowner' as defined here (a serious mistake or blunder that causes failure) is not an established English word or phrase for this meaning. In established dictionaries and common English usage, 'goose-drowner' is either not found or is a rare slang term, sometimes regionally, meaning a heavy downpour of rain, not a blunder or mistake. Therefore, this usage is too obscure or potentially incorrect to include as a valid dictionary entry.</p></div>
