                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to 'Edward' as a person (specifically Edward V of England), and the definition is specific to that historical individual. As a proper noun referring to a unique person, and with the synset 'person' being too general, this concept should not be included as a dictionary entry for a standard English dictionary.</p></div>
