                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense corresponds to the very general concept of "thing" or "object" as a quantity of no importance, which is too broad and abstract and not specifically tied to the headword 'zero.' The headword 'zero' in its primary dictionary sense refers to the number 0, or a quantity of nothing, but this synset is about any 'thing of no importance' and includes words like 'nothing,' 'nil,' 'naught,' etc., which are either pronouns or represent the idea of 'nothingness.' Thus, this is too generic and not a dictionary-worthy sense unique to the headword 'zero.'</p></div>
