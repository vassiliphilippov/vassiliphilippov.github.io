                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'pickaninny Christmas' is primarily a derogatory phrase rooted in outdated cultural stereotypes, and it does not represent a standalone lexical item with significant usage beyond being a specific instance of an offensive expression involving 'pickaninny'. Furthermore, it is not widely recognized as an established term and would not typically appear as an entry in reputable dictionaries like Oxford; instead, the offensive term 'pickaninny' itself would be covered as a dictionary entry, with context notes if required. Therefore, it should be excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
