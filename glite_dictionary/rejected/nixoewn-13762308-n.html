                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described is 'a quantity of no importance', which is the broad, generic sense conceptualized as pronouns like 'nothing', 'nil', or slang like 'zilch' or 'nix'. However, 'nix' itself is not commonly used as a noun in standard English to mean 'nothing' (in contrast to 'nix' as a verb, meaning 'to reject'). Including 'nix' as a noun meaning 'nothing' is not supported by major dictionaries like Oxford; it's not a recognized standard noun in this sense. Therefore, the concept should not be included.</p></div>
