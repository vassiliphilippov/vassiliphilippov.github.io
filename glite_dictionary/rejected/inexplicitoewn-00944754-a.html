                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'inexplicit' is simply an uncommon synonym for 'implicit'. Its primary sense is already captured under the standard term 'implicit', which is the widely used and dictionary-standard headword for this sense. 'Inexplicit' is extremely rare in modern usage, barely occurs in real English, and is not included in Oxford Dictionary or mainstream reference works as an independent entry. Learners are better served by the entry for 'implicit'. Therefore, it should not be included as a main headword.</p></div>
