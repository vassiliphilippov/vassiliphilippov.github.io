                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'teched manner' refers to a specific usage of 'teched', which is a dialectal or regional variant of 'touched' (meaning a little bit crazy or eccentric). However, 'teched manner' as a fixed phrase is not established or widely attested, and would not appear as a headword in a major dictionary such as Oxford. The commonly recognized term would be 'teched' or 'tetched' as an adjective, not the phrase 'teched manner'. Therefore, this should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
