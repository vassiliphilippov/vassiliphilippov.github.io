                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Captain John Smith' as given refers to a specific person, whose synset is simply 'person'. This is too general a category for inclusion as a dictionary entry, as dictionaries like Oxford include proper nouns referring to individuals only when they are of significant cultural or historical importance, and the entry's synset directly relates to the headword. However, in this case, the synset is just 'person', which is too broad.</p></div>
