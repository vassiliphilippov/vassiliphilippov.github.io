                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'beefsteak Nazi' is a rarely attested, extremely niche slang formation and does not have widespread currency in English. It is a nonstandard, ad hoc phrase based on a pattern ('X Nazi') that may be perceived as offensive or insensitive due to its use of the word 'Nazi.' It does not meet the inclusion criteria for a standard dictionary such as Oxford, as it is not widely recognizable or established as a set phrase.</p></div>
