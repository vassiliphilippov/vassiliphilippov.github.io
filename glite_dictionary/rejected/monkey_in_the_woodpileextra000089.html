                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'monkey in the woodpile' is rare and derives from a historically offensive idiom ('nigger in the woodpile'), which is widely recognized as outdated and objectionable. Its direct variant is not broadly used or accepted in modern standard English, nor would it typically be included in reputable dictionaries due to its problematic origin and infrequency. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
