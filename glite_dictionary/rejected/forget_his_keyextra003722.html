                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'forget his key' is a specific inflected phrase and not a standard dictionary entry or idiom. Dictionaries would list 'forget' as a verb and provide examples, including forms like 'forget his key', but not as a separate entry. The synset is not directly synonymous with the headword â€“ it is a compositional phrase made from 'forget' and its object.</p></div>
