                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset definition in this case refers to 'enhancer' as something serving as a foil or contrast to highlight another thing's good qualities. However, in current standard English usage, 'enhancer' primarily means something that improves or increases another thing, and is not typically used in this contrast/foil sense. This meaning is better covered by the word 'foil.' Including this sense under 'enhancer' could confuse learners, so it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
