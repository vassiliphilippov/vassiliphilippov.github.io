                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'little by little' as 'by a short distance' is too specific and not commonly recognized or distinct enough in general English usage to merit a separate entry. The primary idiomatic meaning of 'little by little' as 'gradually, in small stages' is the one included in standard dictionaries; the sense here is more about incremental movement by short distances, which is not a common or standard meaning for the phrase. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
