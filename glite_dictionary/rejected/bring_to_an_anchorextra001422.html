                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'bring to an anchor' in this context is not a widely recognized idiom or set phrase in standard English, and its usage appears to be rare or highly informal. Additionally, the sense here is metaphorical, based on the nautical 'anchor,' but there is no evidence that this meaning is established, general, or dictionary-worthy. Therefore, it should be excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
