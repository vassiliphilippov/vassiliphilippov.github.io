                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'Bailey' refers to a notable English lexicographer, this use is as a proper noun designating an individual person. In modern dictionaries such as the Oxford Dictionary, such entries are generally reserved for terms of general usage, not for specific biographical names unless the person is extremely famous and the name is widely used as a common noun or adjective (e.g., 'Darwinian'). Therefore, this sense should be excluded.</p></div>
