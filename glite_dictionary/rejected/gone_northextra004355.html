                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'gone north' meaning 'increased significantly or improved' is not a widely recognized idiom or phrasal verb in standard English and would not be included in a major English-English dictionary like the Oxford Dictionary. It appears to be a rare or possibly nonstandard usage, as the common idiomatic phrase for decline is 'gone south,' while 'gone north' is not commonly attested with the opposite meaning. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
