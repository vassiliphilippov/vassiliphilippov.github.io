                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'people mountain' as described here is not a standard term or idiom in English. The examples given refer to the nonstandard calque 'people mountain people sea,' which is itself not established in Oxford or other major English dictionaries. 'People mountain' alone is not a recognized idiom or compound in English usage and does not meet the inclusion criteria for a general English dictionary.</p></div>
