                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to 'King' as a generic label for a person ('United States woman tennis player'), which is too general and not specific to the individual. Entries for people as generic 'person' or 'individual' synsets are not included in general English dictionaries like Oxford unless the sense itself refers to a specialized, non-person meaning. In this case, 'King' representing a specific person (Billie Jean King) would be a proper noun, but her notability would be included under a biographical entry rather than a general dictionary entry. Therefore, the concept should be filtered out.</p></div>
