                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Edward V of England' is essentially that of a person (a specific historical individual), rather than a lexical concept with sufficient general or wider linguistic relevance. Dictionaries like Oxford typically include notable historical figures only when their name has become a term or has wider metaphorical usage, which is not the case here. Thus, this does not merit inclusion as a dictionary headword beyond encyclopedic content.</p></div>
