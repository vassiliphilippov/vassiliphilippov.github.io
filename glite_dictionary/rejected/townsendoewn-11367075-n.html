Such biographical entries like 'Townsend' as an individual are not normally included in general-purpose English dictionaries such as Oxford, unless the person's name has acquired additional, broadly used lexical meaning (e.g., 'Machiavellian'). Thus, it should be excluded as per guidelines.</p></div>
