                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'great chaunter' is a descriptive phrase consisting of 'great' (an adjective) and 'chaunter' (a noun meaning a singer or chanter), used here to mean a skilled performer of songs or chants. However, it is not an established compound, idiom, or set phrase in English dictionaries, and its synset is not specific to this phrase; rather, it refers to someone who is skilled at chanting. Thus, the concept does not merit its own separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
