                        <div class='definition'>a city in northwestern Belgium that is connected by canal to the North Sea; in the 13th century it was a leading member of the Hanseatic League; the old city (known as the City of Bridges) is a popular tourist attraction</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'City of Bridges' in this context is a descriptive nickname for the city of Bruges, not a standalone entry or well-established proper noun. Its synset is essentially a place (Bruges), which would be covered under the entry for 'Bruges.' Such epithets or nicknames are rarely included as headword entries in dictionaries like Oxford unless extremely widely recognized, which is not the case here.</p></div>
