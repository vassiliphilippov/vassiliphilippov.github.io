                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Sofia Scicolone' is 'person', which is too general and not specifically about her as a dictionary entry. In English dictionaries, personal names are only included if they are highly notable under their common public name (stage name, pen name, etc.), not under their birth name unless that is widely used. 'Sofia Scicolone' is better known as 'Sophia Loren', which would warrant an entry, not her birth name.</p></div>
