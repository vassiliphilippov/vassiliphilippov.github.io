                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'paying attention' is represented here as an adjective sense similar to 'heedful.' As an adjective phrase, 'paying attention' is not conventional in dictionary headword listings; instead, words like 'heedful' or 'attentive' would appear. The phrase 'paying attention' itself is better described as the present participle form (verb phrase) of 'pay attention,' which is more idiomatic. This synset covers the general property of being attentive, but 'paying attention' is not appropriate as an adjective dictionary entry. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
