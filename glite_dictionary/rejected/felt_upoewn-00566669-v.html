                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'felt up' in this sense (meaning to become matted and felt-like) is not an established or recognizable English phrasal verb in general usage; it is likely a technical or fringe formation from 'felt' as a verb plus a particle, not standard English. Furthermore, the common and attested usage is 'felt' as a verb (to make into felt), and there is a very different, widely-known informal meaning of 'felt up' (to touch someone sexually without their consent), which would be (if included) tagged as slang/offensive. Therefore, this sense is too marginal and does not belong in a general English dictionary like Oxford.</p></div>
