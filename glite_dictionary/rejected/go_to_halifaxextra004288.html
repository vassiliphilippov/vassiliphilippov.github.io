                        <div class='examples'><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>When he didn't want to deal, he'd say to go to Halifax.</blockquote><blockquote>He rolled his eyes and told his boss to go to Halifax.</blockquote><blockquote>She just wanted to avoid the argument and said go to Halifax.</blockquote></div>
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'go to Halifax' appears to be an uncommon, possibly extremely regionally limited or idiosyncratic idiom. It does not appear in major dictionaries, and there is little evidence it has sufficient currency in the English language to warrant a dictionary entry. Additionally, its usage as a phrase of dismissal or avoidance is not established broadly like similar idioms ('go to hell', etc.), and without broader attestation it would not be included in major English dictionaries such as the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
