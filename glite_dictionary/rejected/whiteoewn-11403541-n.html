                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to a person ('United States educator who in 1865 (with Ezra Cornell) founded Cornell University and served as its first president (1832-1918)'), and WordNet's synset is simply 'person', which is too generic. Only specific proper nouns with substantial independent identity beyond 'person' would be included; general references to individual persons with generic meanings are excluded from standard English dictionaries.</p></div>
