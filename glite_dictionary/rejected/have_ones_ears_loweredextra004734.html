                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'have one's ears lowered' as described here (meaning to receive advice, gossip, or to get one's hair cut) is not an established or widely recognized idiom in standard English. There is some evidence of its rare informal use meaning 'to get a haircut,' but the 'receive advice or gossip' sense is not standard or widely attested. This phrase would not typically appear in a general dictionary such as the Oxford Dictionary, as it is neither common nor idiomatic in contemporary or historical English.</p></div>
