                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept is an expanded contraction ('they would have been lost') and does not represent a distinct word, idiom, phrasal verb, or fixed phrase that has meaning beyond its literal components. It is constructed grammatically from the standard words 'they,' 'would,' 'have,' 'been,' and 'lost.' Such forms are not included in standard dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary unless they have a distinct, nonliteral meaning or idiomatic usage.</p></div>
