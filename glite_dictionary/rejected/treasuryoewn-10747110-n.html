                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'Treasury' refers specifically to a position in the British government and is a named role, not a general lexical meaning. The primary lexical sense of 'Treasury' as a noun (government department responsible for financial matters) is included in dictionaries, but this sense as a cabinet minister (actually better described as the 'Chancellor of the Exchequer') is too specific for a general dictionary entry under 'Treasury.' It is more appropriately covered under entries like 'Chancellor of the Exchequer' or as a description under 'Treasury' (referring to the institution, not the person).</p></div>
