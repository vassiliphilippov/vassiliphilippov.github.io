                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'round of wogball' is a specific phrase containing 'wogball,' which is a derogatory or slang term with problematic and offensive connotations. Furthermore, the synset (a general 'game of a playful sport') is not unique or specific enough to justify inclusion as a dictionary entry, as it does not provide an independent, standard, or widely recognized meaning distinct from its components. As such, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a dictionary headword or phrase.</p></div>
