                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The provided concept uses 'safety' to refer to a contraceptive device (i.e., condom), which is not a standard or widely recognized usage in contemporary English. The primary senses of 'safety' in dictionaries refer to the condition of being safe or measures taken to remain safe, not to a contraceptive. This sense would not appear as a headword or major definition in reputable dictionaries such as the Oxford Dictionary. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
