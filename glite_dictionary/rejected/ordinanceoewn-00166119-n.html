                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The headword 'ordinance' in this synset refers specifically to 'the act of ordaining' in religious sense. However, 'ordinance' is not commonly used in modern English with this meaning; 'ordination' is the standard term for the act of conferring holy orders. Therefore, this sense is too obscure or potentially confused with the more common 'ordination', and would not be included as a main entry in a modern learner's dictionary for this meaning.</p></div>
