                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to 'people who have retreated,' which is not a standard noun sense of 'retreated' in English. This usage is extremely rare and does not appear in reputable English dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster. 'Retreated' is not commonly used as a noun to refer to people; the correct noun would be 'retreaters' or a descriptive phrase such as 'those who have retreated.' Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
