                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to 'Hays' as a person, specifically Will H. Hays. In this synset, the concept is too general as it simply refers to a person's name, not a meaning or term that would merit a dictionary entry apart from a biographical proper noun listing. Such names are usually excluded unless the person is exceptionally well-known in a way that their name is used as a common noun or concept, which does not apply here.</p></div>
