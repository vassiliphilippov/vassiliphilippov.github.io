                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to 'Bush' as a person identified only by office (vice president and 41st President), but the synset is simply 'person' or proper noun. Including this entry with only this description would be too general and not dictionary-appropriate; dictionaries typically list 'Bush' as a proper noun referring to the specific person with a biographical entry, not just a role description. This form would not appear as such in Oxford or similar dictionaries.</p></div>
