                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Lubavitch' refers to a specific place (a town in Belarus) rather than a unique, widely used English term or proper noun with an established meaning in English beyond the place itself. Dictionary entries typically do not include all place names unless they have additional significance beyond being geographic locations. In standard dictionaries, most cities, towns, or villages are excluded unless they have taken on a widely used sense beyond their geographic meaning, which is not the case here.</p></div>
