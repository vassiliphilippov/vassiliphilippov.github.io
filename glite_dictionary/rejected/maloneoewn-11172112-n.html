                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense describes 'Malone' as a person (Edmond Malone), and the synset is essentially 'person', which is too general and does not correspond to an entry that would appear as such in a general dictionary. Proper noun senses of individuals are only included in encyclopedias, not standard dictionaries, unless the person is so prominent that their name enters general vocabulary (e.g., 'Einstein' as a term for 'genius'). Thus, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
