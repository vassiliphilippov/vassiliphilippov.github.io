                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Mrs. Humphrey Ward' is simply 'person', which is too general and does not provide a specific sense or notable lexical meaning related to the headword beyond being a proper noun for an individual. Such biographical entries are not typically included in general English dictionaries like Oxford unless the person has become an eponym or entered the language with extended meaning. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
