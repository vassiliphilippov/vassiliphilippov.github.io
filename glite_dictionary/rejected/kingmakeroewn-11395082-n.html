                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to the historical figure known as 'Kingmaker' (Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick), but the synset is simply a person; we do not include biographical titles based solely on a person's role when the term is not used generally as a dictionary entry for people. Instead, 'kingmaker' as a general term for someone who brings a leader to power is dictionary-worthy, but not the specific biographical sense.</p></div>
