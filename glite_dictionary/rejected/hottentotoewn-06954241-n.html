                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'Hottentot' in this sense refers to Khoisan languages, but 'Hottentot' is now widely recognized as an offensive and outdated term for both the languages and people. The modern and appropriate terms are 'Khoisan' for the language family and 'Khoikhoi' for the people. Leading dictionaries have dropped or heavily cautioned against the usage of 'Hottentot' except as a historical note, and its synset is more general than a language name (it can mean the people, language, or related things). Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry except possibly with very strong historical/offensive labels, but in this context it is best excluded.</p></div>
