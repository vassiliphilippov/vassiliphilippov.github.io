                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The given sense associates 'schoolwork' with any kind of work done at home, which is too broad and not the standard meaning of 'schoolwork.' 'Schoolwork' specifically refers to assignments or studies completed as part of education, not to general home-based work. The synonym set here is too general and does not align with the headword's typical dictionary usage.</p></div>
