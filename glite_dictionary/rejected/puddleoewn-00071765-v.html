                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'puddle' as a verb meaning 'to eliminate urine' is extremely rare and nonstandard. It is not commonly recognized in standard English dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster. The commonly accepted meanings of 'puddle' are as a noun (a small pool of liquid) and as a verb (to make something into or cover with a puddle). This specific usage (to urinate, especially referring to animals) is not widespread, standard, or notable enough for inclusion.</p></div>
