                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Madame Tussaud' here is 'person', which is too general and not specific to her as an individual entry. In a standard English dictionary, proper names that are only entries because they are persons (as opposed to names of institutions or works derived from them) are typically not included unless they have acquired additional non-person meanings in English. This entry describes her only as a historical person.</p></div>
