                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'Leakey' refers to a specific individual (Richard Leakey) and would be categorized as a proper noun referring to a person. Major dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary generally do not include individual people's names unless they have become eponymous or refer to something else. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
