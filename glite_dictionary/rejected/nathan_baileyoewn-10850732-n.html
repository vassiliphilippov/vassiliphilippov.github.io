                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is simply 'person', as this is a proper noun referring to an individual's name, not a concept likely to be included in an English dictionary like the Oxford Dictionary. Dictionaries do not generally include standard biographical entries unless the person is so significant that their name has also become a common noun or adjective (e.g., 'Einstein' as meaning 'a genius').</p></div>
