                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'canvas' refers to a tent made of canvas fabric, but the standard dictionary entry for 'canvas' is focused on the material itself, not on objects made from it. The meaning "a tent made of canvas" is too specific and peripheral; standard dictionaries would list 'canvas' primarily as a type of fabric and possibly mention its uses (such as tents, sails), but would not define it as a tent itself. This concept does not warrant a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
