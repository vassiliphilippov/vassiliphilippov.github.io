                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'autem mort' is a Latin phrase and not an established term in English usage. English dictionaries like Oxford include only foreign phrases that are used as loanwords or set expressions in English. 'Autem mort' does not meet this criterion, as it is neither frequently encountered in English literature nor conventionalized as an English term. Additionally, it appears to be a partial or unusual Latin expression rather than a recognized phrase. Therefore, it should not be included as a headword in an English-English dictionary.</p></div>
