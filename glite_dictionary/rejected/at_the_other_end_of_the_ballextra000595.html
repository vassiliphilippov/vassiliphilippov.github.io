                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'at the other end of the ball' does not appear to be a widely recognized English idiom or set phrase in reputable dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster. Its usage seems very rare, and it does not have an established meaning in standard English. It is possible this is an idiosyncratic usage or a misinterpretation of more common idioms (e.g., 'at the other end of the spectrum,' 'at the other end of the table'). Therefore, this concept should not be included in a dictionary.</p></div>
