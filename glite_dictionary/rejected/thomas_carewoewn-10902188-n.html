                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept represents a person, and the synset is simply that of a proper noun referring to an individual (Thomas Carew). Dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary typically include entries for very famous historical or literary figures, but only when they have additional lexical significance beyond being a biographical name. In this case, 'Thomas Carew' is a proper noun used as a name, and its sense is not specific or distinct from a general biographical listing. As such, it should not be included as an English word or lexical item.</p></div>
