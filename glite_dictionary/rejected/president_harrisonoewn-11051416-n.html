                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'President Harrison' here is a general reference to the individual person, based on his role and biographical details. Dictionary entries typically only include proper nouns where there is a standalone cultural, historical, or linguistic significance beyond a specific person, and they do not generally cover individual people unless they are needed for language understanding. This concept is biographical and not linguistically distinctive; thus, including it would not be appropriate for a dictionary entry as defined.</p></div>
