                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'called a shrew' is not a standard word, idiom, or set phrase that would be listed as a dictionary entry. The insult 'shrew' qualifies as a dictionary entry, but the construction 'called a shrew' does not. It is simply a verb (called) followed by a noun used as an insult. The concept is too compositional and does not have an idiomatic meaning beyond its parts.</p></div>
