                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'counting his days' is a compositional usage of 'counting' and 'days,' not an established idiom or set phrase that would appear as a headword in Oxford-style dictionaries. It is not fixed or widely recognized with a specific non-literal meaning, and can be replaced by similar constructions like 'counting the days.' Therefore, it should not be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
