                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a derogatory or slang term that is constructed around specific partisan neologisms ('Republicunt', 'Republithug'), and does not represent a widely recognized term 'Republican behavior' with a specific, dictionary-worthy meaning separate from its component words. The synset is instead too general and not standard as a headword, so it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
