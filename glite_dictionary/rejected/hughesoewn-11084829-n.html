                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is related to the proper noun 'Hughes' with the very general sense of 'person' (referring specifically to Howard Hughes), which is not specific enough for an English dictionary entry. Oxford-style dictionaries typically do not include biographical entries for individuals unless they are extremely notable, and even so, they would be under encyclopedic coverage rather than a dictionary definition. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
