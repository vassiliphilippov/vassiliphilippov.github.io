                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Ipsus' in this sense refers specifically to a historical event—the Battle of Ipsus—rather than to a common noun or term with a general use. While proper names of significant battles sometimes appear in major encyclopedias or historical reference works, they are generally not included as main entries in standard English-English dictionaries unless they have become widespread eponyms or have significant linguistic meaning beyond their function as a name. Thus, this concept is filtered out as it is primarily a proper noun referring to a specific place/event, not a general dictionary headword.</p></div>
