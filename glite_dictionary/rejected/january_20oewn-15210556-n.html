                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a specific date with a religious or folkloric tradition, but the term 'January 20' as such is not established as a standard or widely recognized dictionary entry denoting a Christian holy day. It is too specific to be included as a headword in an English-English dictionary like Oxford, unless it had widespread or historical significance under that exact name. 'Saint Agnes' Eve' would be a proper entry, but not 'January 20'.</p></div>
