                        <div class='definition'>a terrorist organization in Sri Lanka that began in 1970 as a student protest over the limited university access for Tamil students; currently seeks to establish an independent Tamil state called Eelam; relies on guerilla strategy including terrorist tactics that target key government and military personnel</div>
                        <div class='examples'><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>the Tamil Tigers perfected suicide bombing as a weapon of war</blockquote></div>
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is for a specific organization, the "Tigers" (specifically, the Tamil Tigers or LTTE), but is labeled only as "Tigers," which is ambiguous and would not appear as a dictionary headword with this meaning. As a standard dictionary entry, "Tigers" is not generally understood to mean the terrorist organization; the name "Tamil Tigers" or "Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)" would be the accurate entry. Therefore, this concept is too specific and not appropriate for inclusion under the headword "Tigers."</p></div>
