                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'electric Jew' refers to a specific ethnicity combined with a colloquial adjective and is not widely recognized, standard, or appropriate for general dictionary inclusion. Additionally, there is potential for causing offense due to referencing an ethnic or religious group in a casual or stereotyped manner, even if claimed to be used playfully. Such a term would not appear in standard dictionaries like Oxford and should be excluded.</p></div>
