                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept provided combines two distinct senses: (1) A 'linear meter' as a measurement of length (in meters, along a single dimension), and (2) An electronic measuring instrument in which the dial deflection is proportional to the quantity measured. However, 'linear metre' in standard dictionaries almost always refers to the first meaning (a length), and the technical device meaning is very rare, specialist, and confusing here. Furthermore, the synset seems to conflate the measurement unit and the instrument. As a result, this is either too general or too specialized/confused for standard learners' dictionaries, and should not be included as a clear entry.</p></div>
