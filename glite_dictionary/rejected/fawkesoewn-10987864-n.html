                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to 'Fawkes' only as a person (Guy Fawkes), and its synset is 'person', which is too general. Such proper names, unless they become common nouns or derivatives with a specialized meaning, are excluded as per guidelines. 'Fawkes' as a proper noun referring to an individual would not ordinarily appear in a standard dictionary except for encyclopedic use.</p></div>
