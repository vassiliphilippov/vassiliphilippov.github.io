                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for "Tyndall" in this context is simply indicating he is a person (proper noun, individual's name). Dictionary entries for biographical proper nouns typically only include especially notable historical or cultural figures. While some major dictionaries include scientists of fundamental importance, "Tyndall" is of more specialized or encyclopedic interest and is not generally included as a headword in general English dictionaries such as Oxford in this way. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
