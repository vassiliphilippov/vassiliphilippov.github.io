                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'wed' as an adjective meaning 'having been taken in marriage' is mostly archaic or rare except in fixed phrases (such as 'newly-wed'). Modern usage of 'wed' as an adjective is uncommon and usually appears only as a past participle (as in 'the couple were wed'), not as a standalone adjective. Dictionary entries focus on 'wed' as a verb or in compounds like 'newly-wed'. Therefore, this adjectival sense does not warrant its own entry.</p></div>
