                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'fine' as an adverb meaning 'an expression of agreement' (e.g., starting a sentence with 'Fine, I'll do it.') is very informal, but the basic usage is already well covered under standard dictionary entries for 'fine' as an interjection or informal adverb. More importantly, this sense is too marginal and overlaps with 'fine' as an interjection, which is a standard entry in Oxford and other dictionaries. The entry here is not a distinct enough meaning to merit a separate dictionary entry; it's covered under existing definitions as an interjection or discourse marker.</p></div>
