                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'SL' refers to 'Shining Path,' and in this context, 'SL' is merely an abbreviation used for the group. Abbreviations of organizational names, unless extremely widely used in general English (e.g., 'UN', 'FBI'), are not typically included as dictionary headwords. Moreover, the headword here ('SL') is not generally used in English outside specialized or context-specific writing, and does not merit a standalone entry per Oxford Dictionary standards. The proper noun 'Shining Path' itself would be the dictionary headword for this sense, not 'SL'.</p></div>
