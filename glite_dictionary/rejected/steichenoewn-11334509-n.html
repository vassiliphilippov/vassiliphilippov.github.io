                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Steichen' in this context is simply 'person', which is too general. The entry refers specifically to a proper noun (the surname of a notable person), and dictionary entries for personal names are typically included only if the person is exceptionally significant to general language or culture. Even then, English dictionaries rarely include biographical entries unless the person is highly influential and their name is commonly used as a reference. Therefore, this concept should be excluded as the synset is not sufficiently specific to the headword.</p></div>
