                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to the surname 'Harrison' as used for a specific person (the ninth President of the United States), but with a synset of 'person' for the name alone. Dictionary entries include 'Harrison' as a surname and sometimes for particularly notable historical figures by full name (e.g., 'William Henry Harrison'), but not typically for the single surname in this sense. The synset is too general and thus does not meet inclusion criteria.</p></div>
