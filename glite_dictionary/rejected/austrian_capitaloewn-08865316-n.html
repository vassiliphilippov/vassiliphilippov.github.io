                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept "Austrian capital" in this context refers to Vienna, which should be included in the dictionary as a proper noun (Vienna). However, the phrase "Austrian capital" as a common noun referring to "the capital of Austria" is too general and not an established dictionary headword. It does not warrant a dictionary entry, as it functions purely as a descriptive phrase, not as an independent lexical item.</p></div>
