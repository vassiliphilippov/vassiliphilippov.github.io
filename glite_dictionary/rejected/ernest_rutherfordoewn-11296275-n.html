                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Ernest Rutherford' is a proper noun referring to a specific person; the synset is sufficiently specific (physicist), but it primarily denotes a historical figure. Biographical entries for widely known scientists like Rutherford do appear in comprehensive dictionaries, but most mainstream dictionaries limit such entries to the most globally influential historical figures (such as Newton, Einstein, Shakespeare). While Rutherford is highly significant in physics, for a general-purpose dictionary, proper noun biographical entries are usually limited unless the person is a central part of general culture or language. Therefore, this entry is excluded based on standard dictionary inclusion criteria.</p></div>
