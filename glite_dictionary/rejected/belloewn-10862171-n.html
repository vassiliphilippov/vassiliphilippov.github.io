                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for this concept is too general, referring simply to 'person' rather than a specific, dictionary-entry-worthy sense. 'Bell' as a surname or as Alexander Melville Bell (the phonetician) does not typically warrant a separate entry unless the person is extremely notable and commonly referenced; in dictionaries, individual non-notable people are usually not included unless they have major historical or cultural significance. The concept as presented is about an individual (Alexander Melville Bell), whose primary legacy is as the father of Alexander Graham Bell and as a phonetician, but does not meet criteria for inclusion as a headword in an English-English dictionary outside of encyclopedias or biographical references.</p></div>
