                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The word 'nobble' in this sense ('take away to an undisclosed location against their will and usually in order to extract a ransom') refers to 'kidnap.' While 'nobble' has other accepted meanings in English (e.g., to tamper with, bribe, or injureâ€”especially in horse racing), this specific sense is not attested or commonly recognized in major English dictionaries. Therefore, this sense should not be included as it is either obsolete, extremely rare, or not standard English usage.</p></div>
