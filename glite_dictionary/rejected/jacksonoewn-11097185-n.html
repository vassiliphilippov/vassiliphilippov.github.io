                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for this sense of 'Jackson' is 'person', which is too general and not specific to the proper noun or the individual's biography. Dictionary entries typically don't include individual people unless their names become common nouns or have widely recognized symbolic meaning. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
