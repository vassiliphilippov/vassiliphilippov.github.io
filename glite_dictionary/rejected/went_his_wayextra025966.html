                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'went his way' is a standard past tense form of 'go one's way', which is a possible entry. However, 'went his way' is not an established idiom or fixed phrase with an independent meaning, but simply a grammatically-formed expression. Dictionary entries typically cover the base form or the idiomatic phrase ('go one's way'), not each inflected variant with a pronoun. Therefore, it does not warrant a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
