                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>'February 22' as a term for 'the day on which George Washington is remembered' is overly specific and functions as a date, not as a lexicalized concept or dictionary headword. Such calendar dates are not typically included as dictionary entries unless they have become established holidays or terms in English (e.g., 'Christmas,' 'Independence Day'). As 'February 22' is simply a date and does not universally denote a holiday in this sense, it should not be included as a standalone dictionary entry.</p></div>
