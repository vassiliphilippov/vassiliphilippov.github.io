                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of "fall out" as "come to pass" (i.e., to happen or occur) is extremely rare and not a standard meaning in modern English usage. Well-known dictionaries like Oxford and Merriam-Webster do not list this sense for "fall out." Its occurrence is archaic, obsolete, or so rare that it would not be useful or common enough for inclusion. The usual meanings of "fall out" (e.g., to have a disagreement, or for hair/teeth to drop out) are included in dictionaries, but not this one.</p></div>
