                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Bayer' here refers to a trade name (brand name) for acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) rather than the word itself with an independent meaning. The dictionary would include 'aspirin', but 'Bayer' as a proprietary drug name is specific to branding and is not an independent lexical word or common noun. Therefore, it should not have a standalone entry except as a brand or proper noun referring to the company, which is not the sense described.</p></div>
