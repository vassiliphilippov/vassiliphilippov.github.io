                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense of 'starting' here refers to an instance or turn of being a starter in a game, which is a very specific and context-dependent noun usage. While the verb 'start' and noun 'starter' are common in English, this noun 'starting' meaning 'a turn to be a starter' is not established as an independent dictionary entry in general English usage; rather, it is a contextual usage within sports jargon and not sufficiently widespread or distinct as a headword. Thus, it should not be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
