                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'on cloud seven' is a rare variant of the standard idiom 'on cloud nine', which is the widely recognized form meaning 'extremely happy'. 'On cloud seven' is not standard or common enough to merit inclusion in a general English dictionary like Oxford; it is likely used by confusion or as a nonstandard variant. Thus, it should be excluded.</p></div>
