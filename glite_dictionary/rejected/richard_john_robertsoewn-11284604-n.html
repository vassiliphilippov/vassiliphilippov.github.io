                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is primarily the person's name (Richard John Roberts), and the sense is a specific individual (a biochemist), so its synset is 'person'. According to dictionary standards, individual people's names, unless extremely iconic or genericized, are not included as dictionary entries. This matches Oxford's treatment, which does not list non-iconic modern people as dictionary entries. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
