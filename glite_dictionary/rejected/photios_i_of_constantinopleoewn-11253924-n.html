                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Photios I of Constantinople' is too general, corresponding primarily to a named person (proper noun) rather than a distinctive lexical concept or term. Such proper names of historical figures, while notable, are generally excluded from standard English-English dictionaries like Oxford unless their names have become common nouns, adjectives, or have acquired a broader lexical meaning. Therefore, this should not be included.</p></div>
