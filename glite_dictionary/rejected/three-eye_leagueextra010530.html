                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Three-Eye League' is too specific and appears to refer to a particular fictional or organizational name, rather than a general term or phrase with broad usage. It would not generally appear as an entry in the Oxford Dictionary unless the organization were widely notable, which is not indicated here. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
