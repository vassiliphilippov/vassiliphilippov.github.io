                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'peter puffer' appears to be a slang, derogatory insult and is also potentially vulgar, with origins related to offensive innuendo rather than strictly denoting someone who boasts or exaggerates. Its primary real-world usage is as an offensive slur, not as a general term for a boaster or exaggerator. Given its offensive and vulgar nature, and the lack of widespread or standard usage in the described sense, it is best excluded from a general-purpose English dictionary. Additionally, its etymology and actual meaning are more associated with derogatory, offensive slang rather than the synonym for a braggart as described in the synset.</p></div>
