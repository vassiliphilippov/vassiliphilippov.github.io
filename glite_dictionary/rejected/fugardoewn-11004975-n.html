                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Fugard' here refers to a specific person (Athol Fugard). The synset is effectively 'person,' which is too general and does not correspond to a lexicalized sense that would be included in a standard English dictionary (which lists proper names only when they are used as common nouns or adjectives with specific derived meanings). Therefore, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
