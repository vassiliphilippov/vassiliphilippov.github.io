                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is for 'king' (person), which is too general for the headword 'Louis XIV of France.' Proper nouns for individual historical figures are not typically included as dictionary entries in traditional English-English dictionaries like Oxford; instead, they are covered in encyclopedias. The entry would only be included if the sense was a specialized or lexicalized use apart from an individual's name.</p></div>
