                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept does not have significant attestation or recognition as an established idiom in English. Furthermore, the described meaning (lost control of emotions or made a strong point) is not widely associated with the phrase, and there is no standard usage in reputable dictionaries. The phrase's form and examples appear contrived rather than genuinely lexicalized.</p></div>
