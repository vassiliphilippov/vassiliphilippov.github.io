                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense defines 'canvass' as a large piece of fabric used to propel a sailing vessel, but this usage and definition properly correspond to the word 'canvas' (with one 's'), not 'canvass' (with double 's'), which is not standard for this meaning. Furthermore, 'canvass' is not used as a noun in this sense in standard English. The entry should not be included as it does not meet dictionary criteria for canonical word usage.</p></div>
