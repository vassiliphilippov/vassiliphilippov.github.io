                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Hoffmann' is 'person', which is too general and not unique or specific to this individual's achievements or identity. Dictionary entries generally do not include biographical entries for proper names unless the person is exceptionally notable and commonly referenced, in which case more context and notability would be established (such as 'Einstein'). 'Hoffmann' as given is not specific enough, and does not warrant inclusion as a stand-alone dictionary entry.</p></div>
