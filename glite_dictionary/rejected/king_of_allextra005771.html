                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'king of all' in this sense refers to an idiomatic phrase 'king of all (one surveys)', but as a standalone phrase 'king of all' is not a standard lexical item with an established meaning in English. Rather, it forms part of a longer set phrase ('king of all one surveys'), which itself is rarely used and somewhat archaic. Therefore, as 'king of all' does not function as an independent word, idiom, or compound recognized in standard dictionaries, it should be excluded.</p></div>
