                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'James William Fulbright' is essentially 'person,' which is too general and not specific to the headword. Definitions of individual people's biographies (especially those that do not have figurative or lexicalized meaning beyond being a proper noun) are not typically included in a standard English dictionary like Oxford unless the person's name has become a common noun, adjective, or is lexicalized (e.g., 'Machiavellian'). 'James William Fulbright' refers only to a person's name rather than a specific concept, object, or lexicalized term.</p></div>
