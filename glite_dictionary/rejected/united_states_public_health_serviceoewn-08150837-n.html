                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'United States Public Health Service' refers to a specific organization whose synset is 'agency' or 'organization.' Such entries are typically too general for inclusion in a standard English dictionaryâ€”Oxford Dictionary would not have entries for all government agencies unless they have special linguistic or cultural significance. In this case, this is a straightforward proper noun designating a government agency, and does not meet the filtering criteria for inclusion.</p></div>
