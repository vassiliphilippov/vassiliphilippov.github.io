                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Beaverbrook' here refers to a specific person (1st Baron Beaverbrook), and its synset is 'person', which is too general. Dictionary entries for proper nouns as individual people appear only if the person is so famous as to warrant inclusion as an encyclopedic entry, not as a lexical item. This is typically handled by an encyclopedia, not a general English dictionary like Oxford unless the surname or title develops special meaning, which is not the case here.</p></div>
