                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'shrew who would not be tamed' refers to a descriptive phrase derived from a literary allusion (primarily Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew') and is not a fixed word, idiom, or set phrase that would appear as an entry in a general dictionary. Instead, the term 'shrew' itself is already covered in dictionaries as a word for a difficult or aggressive woman, and this phrase is simply an elaboration or allusion rather than a standalone lexical item.</p></div>
