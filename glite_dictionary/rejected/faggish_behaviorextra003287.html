                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'faggish behavior' is formed from a highly offensive slur ('faggish') and refers to behavior perceived as flamboyant or effeminate. The term itself derives from 'faggot', which is widely considered an offensive slur against gay men. Mainstream dictionaries, including Oxford, generally do not include derivative or compound terms formed from such slurs except in specifically labelled, cautionary entries, and 'faggish behavior' is not a standard lexical item. Additionally, the phrase is not in widespread neutral usage and would only appear in dictionaries as a rare, strongly derogatory term. Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
