                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Pope Pius II' is essentially 'person,' which is too general. While 'Pope Pius II' is a proper name and a notable historical figure, English dictionaries typically do not include entries for individual historical people unless they have also become common nouns or adjectives. This is properly handled by an encyclopedia, not a dictionary like Oxford. Therefore, it should not be included as a headword in the dictionary.</p></div>
