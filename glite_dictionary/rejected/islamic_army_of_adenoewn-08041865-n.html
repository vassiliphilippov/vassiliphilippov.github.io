                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Islamic Army of Aden' refers to a specific organization (proper noun) whose meaning is fully contained in its name and does not represent a word or multiword expression with independent meaning. Dictionary entries generally do not include names of specific organizations unless they are widely used as dictionary headwords (e.g., 'UN'). It is too proper-noun-specific and not general vocabulary. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
