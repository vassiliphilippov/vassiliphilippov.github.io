                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'ground' refers to an abstract relational foundation or basis, but it is not commonly used in current English with this meaning outside of set phrases such as 'on solid ground,' and in those cases, 'ground' often refers to a more concrete foundation rather than an abstract relation. The concept as described with the provided examples would not typically appear as a dedicated dictionary entry for 'ground' in Oxford or similar dictionaries. The examples provided do not directly use 'ground' in this sense, but rather use other words ('footing,' 'basis'). Therefore, this abstract relational sense of 'ground' does not meet inclusion criteria.</p></div>
