                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'readiness' refers to a specific psychological concept where a person is temporarily predisposed to respond in a particular way, also known as 'set' in psychology. However, this specialized sense is not widely recognized or used in general English, and most dictionaries would not include this technical meaning of 'readiness' under its general senses. Therefore, it should not be included as a standalone entry in a general English-English dictionary.</p></div>
