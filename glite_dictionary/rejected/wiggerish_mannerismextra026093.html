                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'wiggerish mannerism' is derived from 'wigger,' which itself is an offensive slang term, and the synset refers to mannerisms associated with a stereotype. It is not a standard lexicalized term, nor does it represent an established phrase or entry one would find in a reputable dictionary such as Oxford. Additionally, its primary meaning is compositional and based directly on the offensive slang 'wigger,' so it is both unnecessarily derivative and problematic for inclusion as a separate headword.</p></div>
