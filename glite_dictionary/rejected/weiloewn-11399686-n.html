                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Weil' is simply 'person', which is too general and not specific to this individual's achievements or a widely recognized descriptive sense. Standard English dictionaries typically do not include entries for proper nouns of people unless they have achieved exceptional prominence and widespread reference beyond specialist fields; even then, such entries would be much more detailed. In this context, 'Weil' as a mathematician is not generally included in major English dictionaries as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
