                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Isherwood' refers to a specific person (Christopher Isherwood) and is of type 'person', which is too general. Dictionary entries typically only include proper nouns when they denote historically or culturally significant figures with substantial secondary meaning or impact in general language, which may apply here, but as per the instruction to filter out concepts whose synset is just 'person', this should be excluded.</p></div>
