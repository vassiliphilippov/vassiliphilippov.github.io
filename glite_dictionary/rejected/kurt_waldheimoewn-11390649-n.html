                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Kurt Waldheim' is 'person', which is too general and not specific to the headword. As per the filtering criteria, we do not include proper nouns when their synset is a general category like 'person', even if the description is detailed. Therefore, this concept should be excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
