                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'lineage' as a rate of payment for written material based on lines submitted is extremely rare and not in current general use. The primary meanings of 'lineage' relate to ancestry and descent. This payment-related sense is obscure and would not be included in a standard dictionary like Oxford, as contemporary usage does not support it.</p></div>
