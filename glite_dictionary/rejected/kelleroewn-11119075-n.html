                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept is a proper noun referring to a specific person (Helen Keller), and though important, listings of individual historical people with just the name (surname) and generic synset 'person' are typically not included as dictionary headwords unless the name has entered the language with a specific additional meaning. In this context, 'Keller' as a surname does not meet dictionary inclusion criteria.</p></div>
