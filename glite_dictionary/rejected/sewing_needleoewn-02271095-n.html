                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'sewing needle' is a valid noun, the sense described here refers to a zoological term (the insect) that is not commonly known or used as a standard English meaning. In standard dictionaries, this insect is generally known as a 'damselfly.' Therefore, the concept is excluded because the synset is not directly related to the headword in a way that would match general English usage.</p></div>
