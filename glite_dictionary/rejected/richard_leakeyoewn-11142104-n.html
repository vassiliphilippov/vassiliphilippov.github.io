                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Richard Leakey' is 'person', which is too general and not specifically related to the headword in a way that merits a dictionary entry. While he is a notable individual, dictionaries like Oxford generally do not include proper names unless they have a broader cultural or linguistic significance beyond being a named individual.</p></div>
