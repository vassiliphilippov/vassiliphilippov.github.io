                        <div class='definition'>King of England from 1461 to 1470 and from 1471 to 1483; was dethroned in 1470 but regained the throne in 1471 by his victory at the battle of Tewkesbury (1442-1483)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to 'Edward' as a person (a specific king), and its synset is at the level of 'person' or 'King of England' as a role. Since this is a proper noun for an individual (Edward IV), and dictionaries like Oxford do not generally provide entries for specific historical personages under their first names alone (unless the name itself has acquired additional meaning), this concept is too specific and not appropriate for inclusion as a general dictionary headword.</p></div>
