                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to an individual historical person (Nathan Hale) but the synset is simply 'person' and presents only the name without further disambiguation. Dictionary entries for general English do not include individual personal names unless they are exceptionally prominent standalone entries (e.g., 'Einstein' as a metonym for genius). Therefore, this entry is excluded as it is too general and not suitable for an English dictionary.</p></div>
