                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'PDFLP' (incorrectly spelled; probably refers to DFLP, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine) is being assigned a synset that is too general or organizational ('Marxist-Leninist group') rather than a specific lexical item that would appear as a dictionary headword. The function of the entry is referential and proper-noun-based, largely acting as a label for an organization rather than a word with general lexical usage. Such organizational acronyms aren't typically included unless they have become general dictionary vocabulary. Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
