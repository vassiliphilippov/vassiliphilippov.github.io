                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset described relates to 'upkeep' as the general act of supporting life or subsistence, but in standard English, 'upkeep' is used to refer specifically to the process of maintaining something in good condition, especially buildings, machinery, or property. The broader sense of 'supporting life or subsistence' is not how 'upkeep' is defined or used in reputable dictionaries, and the provided examples do not match typical usage. Therefore, this concept should not be included under 'upkeep' in an English-English dictionary.</p></div>
