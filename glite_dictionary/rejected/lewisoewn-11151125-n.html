                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to a specific person (Carl Lewis) but uses only the surname 'Lewis' as the headword, which is overly broad and general. 'Lewis' as a surname is not specific to the Olympic athlete, and the synset is not uniquely associated with this individual to justify a standalone dictionary entry. Oxford Dictionary does not typically include entries for surnames only when referring to a specific person.</p></div>
