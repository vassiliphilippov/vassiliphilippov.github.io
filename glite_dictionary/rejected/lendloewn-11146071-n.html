                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Lendl' refers to a specific person, Ivan Lendl, and is linked to the synset 'person,' which is too general for inclusion in a standard English dictionary. Such dictionary entries would typically only include widely used proper nouns that have a meaning beyond that of an individual's name (such as 'Einstein' meaning a genius). Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
