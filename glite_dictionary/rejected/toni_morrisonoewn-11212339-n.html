                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Toni Morrison' is a proper noun referring to a specific person, with its synset being 'person' or 'writer.' Dictionaries like Oxford include notable persons by name only if they are of significant cultural or historical importance. Toni Morrison is notable, but general dictionaries do not define people by synset types like 'person.' Her name would appear as a biographical entry, not as a dictionary word. Since this entry is for a person's name under the 'person' synset, it should be excluded according to the filtering criteria.</p></div>
