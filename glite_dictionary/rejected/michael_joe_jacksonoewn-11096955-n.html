                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'Michael Joe Jackson' refers to a specific famous individual, the synset is simply 'person' or 'individual,' which is too general for dictionary inclusion as per instructions. Biographical entries of this sort, where the WordNet synset is just a general person, are not included in dictionaries like Oxford, which generally only include proper nouns for places, organizations, or people if their meaning has taken on special significance. Here, it remains simply a famous person's proper name.</p></div>
