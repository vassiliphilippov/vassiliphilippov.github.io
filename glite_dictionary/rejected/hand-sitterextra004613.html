                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'hand-sitter' is not an established or widely recognized English word. It does not appear in reputable dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster, and its formation and meaning are not standard or widely encountered in either formal or informal English. It seems to be a rare or perhaps idiosyncratic usage that does not meet the threshold for dictionary inclusion.</p></div>
