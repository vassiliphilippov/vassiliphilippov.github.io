                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>'Serve in the infantry' is a transparent phrase and does not represent an idiom, set phrase, or compound with a distinct meaning from its literal parts. It is simply a compositional verb phrase using 'serve' and 'infantry,' both of which appear separately in the dictionary. Such transparent verbal constructions are generally not included as their own entries in major dictionaries unless they are idiomatic or have special historical/cultural significance.</p></div>
