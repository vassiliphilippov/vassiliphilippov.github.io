                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'fashion-fag' refers to a person overly concerned with fashion, but the term contains 'fag', which is widely recognized as a highly offensive slur. The word is not established in current English usage as either standard, slang, or even widely known subcultural vocabulary, and its usage could be considered both obscure and offensive. For these reasons, it should not be included in a standard English-English dictionary, especially when it propagates a derogatory term.</p></div>
