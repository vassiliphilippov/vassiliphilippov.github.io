                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'English writer of novels of espionage (born in 1931)' refers to a specific person, David John Moore Cornwell, who is better known by his pen name John le Carr√©. This is a proper noun entry directly corresponding to a famous individual's name, which dictionaries of the Oxford type typically include only when there is a strong lexical relevance or the person is universally known by this name. However, proper names with synsets relating to just 'person' or descriptions of their occupation (rather than unique lexical meaning) are usually excluded. Therefore, this concept does not qualify for inclusion under the criteria provided.</p></div>
