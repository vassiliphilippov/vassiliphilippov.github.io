                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase "in large quantities" in this context refers to a very general adverbial manner (similar to 'wholesale' as in WordNet's example). However, 'in large quantities' itself does not have an idiomatic or fixed adverbial meaning distinct from the compositional meaning of the individual words. It is a transparent phrase (prepositional phrase) and would not typically warrant a dedicated entry in a standard dictionary like Oxford. The actual dictionary-worthy entry for the sense described would likely be 'wholesale' (adverb), which already exists.</p></div>
