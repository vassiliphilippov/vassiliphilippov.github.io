                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The described synset does not align with the typical or widely recognized meaning of 'smooch' as commonly used in English, which refers to kissing someone amorously. The definition given here is too specific and not widely recognized as a core sense of the verb 'smooch.' This sense would not appear as a separate entry in a major dictionary like Oxford. The standard meaning of 'smooch' as a verb meaning 'to kiss' would be included, but not this specific sense describing lying in a snuggling position.</p></div>
