                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'Anti-Imperialist International Brigade' refers to a specific organization but the WordNet concept is too generalâ€”the sense is 'a terrorist group' rather than a specific encyclopedic entry about this historical group. As such, it does not fit the dictionary (Oxford) inclusion criteria, since we do not list every organizational name that merely fills a generic class unless culturally significant, widely known, or with attested independent lexical status as a term. Furthermore, 'Anti-Imperialist International Brigade' is not the common or established name for this group in English references.</p></div>
