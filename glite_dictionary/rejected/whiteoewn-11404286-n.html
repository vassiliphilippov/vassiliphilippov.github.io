                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to 'White' as a specific person (Edward Douglass White), and it is mainly categorized as 'person' in WordNet. Dictionary entries for general English dictionaries like Oxford list only notable individuals whose full names are commonly used as headwords, not just a surname with a biographical note. Additionally, this sense is too general and not aligned with a dictionary entry for the headword 'White' as a proper noun unless it is uniquely associated with that individual (which would appear as 'Edward Douglass White', not just 'White'). Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
