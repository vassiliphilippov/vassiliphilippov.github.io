                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'famous musician' is a general phrase composed of two common words ('famous' and 'musician'), and does not represent an independent lexical item or set phrase that would be included as a separate entry in a standard English dictionary like Oxford. Dictionary entries are typically for words and common set expressions, not simple noun phrases which can be understood by their parts.</p></div>
