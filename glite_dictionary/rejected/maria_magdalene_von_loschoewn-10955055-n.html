                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is simply 'person', which is too general for a dictionary entry for 'Maria Magdalene von Losch'. The entry does not include any specific sense or meaning beyond being a proper name for an individual and is not notable enough under this name for a general dictionary. Typically, Oxford-type dictionaries include only historic, literary, or major cultural figures if they are widely known by this specific name; this person is better known as Marlene Dietrich.</p></div>
