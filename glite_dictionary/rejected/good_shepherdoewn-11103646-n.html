                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset given is for the historical figure Jesus Christ, with 'Good Shepherd' as a reference or title. However, the sense description is simply 'a teacher and prophet born in Bethlehem...', which is the general 'person' synset for Jesus, not specific to the religious or metaphorical meaning of 'Good Shepherd' itself. Since the synset is not specifically about the notable use of 'Good Shepherd' as a religious title, but rather about the individual himself in a general 'person' synset, it should be excluded according to the filtering criteria.</p></div>
