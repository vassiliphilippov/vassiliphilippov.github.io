                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Richard Erskine Leakey' has a synset of 'person', which is too general and not specific to this individual's notability or field. Dictionary entries for proper nouns like this are only included if the synset is specifically about the individual, not the general category of 'person'. Therefore, this concept should be excluded according to the filtering criteria.</p></div>
