                        <div class='definition'>a small terrorist group of Muslims in South Africa formed in the 1980s; was inspired by Ayatollah Khomeini to create an Islamic state in South Africa</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is overly broad and refers to 'Qibla' specifically as a terrorist group in South Africa, which is a highly specific proper noun. In most dictionaries, 'Qibla' is defined as the direction that should be faced when a Muslim prays, rather than referencing this group. The dictionary would not list every minor organization or group by name, especially when it shares its name with a major religious term; Oxford and similar dictionaries do not include such specific proper nouns unless they have broader cultural or lexical significance.</p></div>
