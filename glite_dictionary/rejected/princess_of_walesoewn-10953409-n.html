                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a specific person with the general label 'English aristocrat' rather than the established title 'Princess of Wales'. As presented, it is a biographical entry about Diana, Princess of Wales, whose name would not appear in a dictionary as a headword under this description. The dictionary would include 'Princess of Wales' as a royal title, but not as a generic category for this individual. Therefore, this concept is too general and should be excluded.</p></div>
