                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'supplement his diet' is a general phrase made up of the verb 'supplement' and the noun phrase 'his diet.' It is not a set phrasal verb, idiom, or compound with specialized meaning beyond its parts. Dictionaries would instead include the verb 'supplement' and its usage with objects such as 'diet.' Therefore, this specific phrase does not warrant its own entry in an English-English dictionary.</p></div>
