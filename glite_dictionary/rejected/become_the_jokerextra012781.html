                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'become the Joker' refers to acting unpredictably or crazily like the fictional comic character. However, this is a specific, recent, and idiomatic usage based on a pop culture reference. It is not established enough, nor is it widely-recognized or commonly used in general English beyond specific contexts. Additionally, the lexical coverage of 'become the Joker' as a set phrase does not warrant its own dictionary entry according to standard lexicographic inclusion criteria (such as those used by the Oxford Dictionary).</p></div>
