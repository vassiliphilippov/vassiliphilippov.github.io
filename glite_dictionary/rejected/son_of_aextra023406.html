                        <div class='examples'><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>I met a son of a famous author yesterday.</blockquote><blockquote>He called himself a son of a beach for living near the coast.</blockquote><blockquote>She’s the son of a beach lover, always by the waves.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s a son of a beach party I won’t forget!</blockquote><blockquote>That kid is a son of a generous man.</blockquote><blockquote>He's a son of a hardworking farmer.</blockquote></div>
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'son of a' by itself is not a standalone entry with a distinct lexical meaning—it functions mainly as the beginning of longer phrases (sometimes expletives, such as 'son of a bitch' or humorous puns like 'son of a beach'). It is not equipped with a specific or consistent independent meaning and would not appear as an entry in a dictionary like Oxford. Instead, its meaning and usage are tracked under specific extensions (e.g., 'son of a bitch'). Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
