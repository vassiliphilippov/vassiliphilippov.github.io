                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'negotiant' does occur in English, especially in the context of wine merchants, this WordNet sense describes it as a general negotiator. In modern English usage, 'negotiant' is not commonly used in the general sense for someone who negotiates; 'negotiator' is the standard and more current term. The general sense is overly broad and would not typically appear as an entry in modern English dictionaries unless specifically referring to its wine trade meaning. Therefore, the concept as defined does not warrant inclusion.</p></div>
