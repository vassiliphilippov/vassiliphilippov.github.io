                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is too general, referring to 'person' as the underlying sense. While 'John Galbraith' is a notable individual, entries for proper nouns that are only biographical (i.e., people) are not typically included in standard English-English dictionaries like Oxford unless their names become common nouns or adjectives, or unless the person is used as part of a multi-word expression. This is a specific person, so it is excluded.</p></div>
