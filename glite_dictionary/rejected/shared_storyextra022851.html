                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'shared story' refers to the general act of exchanging narratives among people, which is covered by the basic meanings of 'share' and 'story' and does not constitute a set phrase or compound in English that warrants a separate dictionary entry. The phrase 'shared story' does not have a distinct or specialized meaning beyond its literal parts, and would not appear as an entry in the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
