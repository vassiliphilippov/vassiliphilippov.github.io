                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is 'person' associated with a specific individual's name (Louis Agassiz), which by itself is too general for a dictionary entry unless there is a special meaning beyond being a proper noun or a historical figure. Such biographical entries are not typically included unless the person's name has acquired an additional meaning (e.g., an eponym). Therefore, this sense should be excluded.</p></div>
