                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'deal' as defined here refers to 'the cards held in a card game by a given player at any given time,' but this sense is more commonly and naturally covered by the word 'hand.' The use of 'deal' in this precise sense is nonstandard and not widely found in reputable dictionaries. Including this sense for 'deal' would be misleading, as it is not commonly used in this way in contemporary English. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a distinct dictionary entry for 'deal.'</p></div>
