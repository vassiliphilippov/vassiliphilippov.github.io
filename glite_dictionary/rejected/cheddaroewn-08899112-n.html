                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Cheddar' as a village is a proper noun and refers to a specific place. Its synset is too general ('village') and, while potentially notable because of its connection to cheddar cheese, place names like this are generally not included in standard English-English dictionaries unless they have become genericized or have standalone linguistic significance. This usage does not meet that criterion.</p></div>
