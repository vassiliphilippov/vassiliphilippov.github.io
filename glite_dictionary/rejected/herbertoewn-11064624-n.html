                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Herbert' here refers specifically to a person's name (Victor Herbert), with the WordNet POS as a noun (proper noun, individual). Such entries typically do not appear as headword entries in general English dictionaries unless they are extremely famous or have become common nouns or adjectives, which is not the case here. Dictionary entries for 'Herbert' would be for the given name or surname, not for individual people unless they are of exceptional renown globally (e.g., Einstein as a concept has broader lexical meaning, but not 'Herbert'). Thus, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
