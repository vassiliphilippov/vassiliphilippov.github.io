                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'as she spoke' represents a simple combination of 'as' (a common conjunction meaning 'while' or 'when') and the past tense of 'speak'. It is not an idiom, set phrase, or lexicalized unit; rather, it is a grammatically regular phrase that follows standard patterns of English syntax. Such specific combinations are not included in dictionaries like Oxford, which focus on lexically significant words, compounds, idioms, and phrasal verbs.</p></div>
