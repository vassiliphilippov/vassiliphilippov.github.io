                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The noun sense of 'starving' as 'the act of depriving of food or subjecting to famine' is not commonly used in modern English and would not typically appear as a main entry in major dictionaries; the standard noun is 'starvation.' This use is rare and mostly academic or archaic. The more common use of 'starving' is as an adjective or present participle, which is listed separately.</p></div>
