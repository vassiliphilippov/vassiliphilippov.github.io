                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'higher status' as defined here refers to a general phrase indicating a comparatively higher rank or position, especially due to seniority. This is a generic, compositional phrase rather than a fixed expression or established compound that would merit its own dictionary entry. Such phrases are typically not included as standalone headwords in major dictionaries unless they have specialized or idiomatic meaning, which is not the case here.</p></div>
