                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset description given here ('to shock, surprise, or confuse greatly') is not the standard, dictionary-recognized meaning of 'blow someone's brains out.' In established dictionaries, this phrase primarily refers to killing someone by shooting them in the head, a graphic and violent sense (sometimes used figuratively to mean extreme mental impact, but rarely and not standard). The sense provided here is not a common or standard enough idiomatic use to merit its own dictionary entry; it's likely a confusion or a nonstandard extension. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
