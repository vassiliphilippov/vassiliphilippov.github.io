                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The expression 'treated like a scut' is not a well-attested idiom or common phrase in contemporary or historical English. Its usage appears non-standard and extremely rare, and it does not have independent lexical status as an idiom or fixed phrase that would warrant inclusion in a dictionary like Oxford. Additionally, the synset meaning overlaps with standard phrases like 'treated with contempt,' which are already covered in established idioms.</p></div>
