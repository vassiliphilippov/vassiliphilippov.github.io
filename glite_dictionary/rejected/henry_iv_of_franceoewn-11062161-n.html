                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Henry IV of France' is a specific historical person whose synset is simply 'person' or 'king'; such biographical entries are not typically included in general English-English dictionaries like Oxford unless the person is extremely historically significant. However, proper noun entries for major historical figures sometimes do appear, but only when their names have become stand-alone terms with extended meanings. Here, the sense is biographical and not specific to a unique meaning of 'Henry IV of France' as a headword outside of encyclopedic contexts.</p></div>
