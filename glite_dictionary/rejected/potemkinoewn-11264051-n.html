                        <div class='definition'>a Russian officer and politician who was a favorite of Catherine II and in 1762 helped her to seize power; when she visited the Crimea in 1787 he gave the order for sham villages to be built (1739-1791)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is 'person', which is too general as a dictionary entry. The name 'Potemkin' would only be included as a proper noun if it has a notable usage in English beyond being a historical Russian person. As described, it is just a biographical entry and does not meet the inclusion criteria for a dictionary entry, since it does not have an established separate meaning in English.</p></div>
