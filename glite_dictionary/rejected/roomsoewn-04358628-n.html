                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset describes 'rooms' as an apartment consisting of several connected rooms, typically in a hotel context. However, in standard English usage, 'rooms' is simply the plural of 'room' and is not widely recognized as a distinct noun meaning an apartment. This specific sense is rare and not standard; it would not appear as a separate dictionary entry in Oxford or similar dictionaries. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
