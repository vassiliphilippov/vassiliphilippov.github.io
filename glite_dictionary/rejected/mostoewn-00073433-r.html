                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense described is of the adverb 'most' meaning 'almost, nearly,' which is archaic and very rare in modern English. This usage is more commonly and naturally expressed by words like 'almost' or 'nearly.' The provided examples where 'most' is said to mean 'almost' ('most everyone agrees') are dialectal or archaic in standard English, and do not represent the typical use of 'most' in contemporary English. As such, this sense does not meet theÂ criteria for inclusion in a modern dictionary unless labeling it as archaic or dialectal, but even then it is extremely uncommon.</p></div>
