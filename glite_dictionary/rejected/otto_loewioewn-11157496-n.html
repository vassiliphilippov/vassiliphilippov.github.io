                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Otto Loewi' is simply 'person', which is too general and not specific to the named individual. Dictionary entries for proper nouns like this should be included only if the synset describes their specific identity or notable achievements rather than categorizing as 'person'. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
