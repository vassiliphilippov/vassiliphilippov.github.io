                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'woman of the town' as defined here ('a prominent or respected woman in a community') is not a widely recognized or standard English idiom or set phrase with this meaning in reputable dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster; it appears to be either nonstandard or potentially regionally limited. Furthermore, 'woman of the town' is more commonly associated with a different, dated meaning ('prostitute'), which could cause confusion. Therefore, this sense should not be included as a dictionary headword.</p></div>
