                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Tyndale' here is used as a proper noun referring to a specific person, William Tyndale. The WordNet synset is simply 'person', which is overly general and not specific to 'Tyndale.' Biographical entries for individuals are generally not included unless they are iconic figures and the synset meaning is closely tied to the name. In this case, the synset is too general to warrant a dictionary entry.</p></div>
