                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to a specific individual (Gary Weinstein) whose synset is 'person'â€”too general and not related to a specific, distinguishable meaning for dictionary users. Furthermore, there may be an error in the definition, as there is no world chess champion named Gary Weinstein; the definition fits Garry Kasparov. Either way, people as such (unless extremely culturally relevant as entries in their own right) are not typically included except with a specific, widely recognized meaning beyond being a person.</p></div>
