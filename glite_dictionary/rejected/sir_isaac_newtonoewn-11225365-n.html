Named individuals as such are not typically included as dictionary entries unless the dictionary covers major historical figures as entries; standard dictionaries like Oxford only occasionally include such figures with very brief information (usually proper nouns of significant historical relevance), but typically not as main entries. This word is therefore filtered out per the supplied criteria.</p></div>
