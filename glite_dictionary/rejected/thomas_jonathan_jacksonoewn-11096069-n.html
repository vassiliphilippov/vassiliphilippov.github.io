                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept is a proper noun referring to a specific person (Thomas Jonathan Jackson), and the synset is tied directly to the individualâ€”not to a generalizable dictionary sense. Dictionary entries for people usually require enduring cultural, historical, or literary significance. While Stonewall Jackson is historically significant, English dictionaries usually only include famous people as entries when their names are used as common nouns or adjectives, or if their significance is very prominent and broad. This entry best fits an encyclopedia rather than a dictionary, and would not appear in the Oxford English Dictionary unless the name developed further lexical meaning. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
