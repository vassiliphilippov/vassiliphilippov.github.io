                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'hand his cards' does not constitute a standard idiom or phrasal verb in contemporary English. It does not appear in major dictionaries, and the usage is unclear and nonstandard. The concept seems to derive from the more common idiom 'show one's hand' or 'lay one's cards on the table.' Therefore, it should not be included as an entry in an English-English dictionary.</p></div>
