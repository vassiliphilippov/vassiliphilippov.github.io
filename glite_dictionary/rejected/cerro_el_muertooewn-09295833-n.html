                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Cerro El Muerto' is properly a specific mountain peak, and would be included in major dictionaries as a notable place name/geographical feature, not as a general category or as a too-general word. However, as a named mountain, it might sometimes be excluded from general-purpose English dictionaries in favor of specialized geographical references or encyclopedias. Nonetheless, Oxford-style dictionaries do sometimes include major mountain peaks, and this peak has significant height and notability. Given that, I would keep it, but if it were simply a generic place entity, I would filter it. On balance, it should be included as a proper noun for those researching world geography.</p></div>
