                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'contact action' in this sense refers to the process of catalysis in chemistry. However, the commonly used and accepted term in both scientific and general English is 'catalysis', not 'contact action'. 'Contact action' as a term for catalysis is archaic or extremely rare and would not be included in a contemporary English-English dictionary such as Oxford. Thus, it should be excluded.</p></div>
