                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'that was a great concert' is a generic statement expressing enjoyment of an event, not an idiom, fixed phrase, or lexicalized unit. It is a compositional sentence, and does not have a non-literal meaning. Such phrases are not typically included in major dictionaries like the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
