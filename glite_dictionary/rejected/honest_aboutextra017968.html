                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'honest about' is a prepositional phrase formed by combining the adjective 'honest' with the preposition 'about.' While it is a common collocational pattern, it is not a set phrase, idiom, or phrasal verb with a specialized meaning distinct from its parts. Dictionaries generally list 'honest' as a headword, and its use with 'about' is intuitive from its core meaning. Such collocations are not included as separate entries in major dictionaries unless they are idiomatic or non-compositional, which is not the case here.</p></div>
