                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Mary McCauley' is simply 'person', which is too general. While she is a historical figure, the concept as given is not specific to her role or achievements beyond being a person. Dictionary entries typically only include proper nouns of significant cultural or historical importance with widely recognized meanings or associations, and with a dedicated synset related to that sense. This entry does not meet those criteria.</p></div>
