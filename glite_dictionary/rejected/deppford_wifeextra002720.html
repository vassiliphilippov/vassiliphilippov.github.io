                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Deppford wife' appears to be a misspelling or confusion with the established term 'Stepford wife', a phrase that is well known and used in English. 'Deppford wife' is not a recognized or standard term in English and does not appear in credible dictionaries. Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
