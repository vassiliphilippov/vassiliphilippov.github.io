                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'reputation as a pretty boy' is a descriptive phrase whose synset is too general and tied to the abstract property 'being known for attractiveness,' rather than being a standalone lexical item. It would not appear as a headword in a standard dictionary like Oxford; such dictionaries would have entries for 'pretty boy' or 'reputation,' but not for this entire phrase as a set expression.</p></div>
