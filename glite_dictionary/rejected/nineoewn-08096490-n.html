                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense of 'nine' here refers specifically to a baseball team, which is a dated and rare usage not commonly found in current English. Additionally, most dictionary users would not look up 'nine' expecting this meaning, and modern reference works typically do not include this as a separate entry. The main meaning of 'nine' as the numeral is far more frequent and relevant. Therefore, it is excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
