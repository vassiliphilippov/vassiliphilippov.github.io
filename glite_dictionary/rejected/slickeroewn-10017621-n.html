                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'slicker' can sometimes be used informally to refer to a clever or deceitful person, it is not commonly or widely established as a primary meaning. The sense described as 'someone who leads you to believe something that is not true' does not warrant a separate entry from the primary meanings of 'slicker' (e.g., a raincoat or someone slick). This specific sense would not typically appear as a main entry in a standard English dictionary such as Oxford.</p></div>
