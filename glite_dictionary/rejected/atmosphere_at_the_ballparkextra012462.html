                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'atmosphere at the ballpark' is a specific instance of the general term 'atmosphere' combined with a location ('at the ballpark'). This phrase is too compositional and not a set phrase or compound that would merit its own dictionary entry, as it simply refers to the atmosphere (environment) experienced at a baseball stadium. It does not have a distinct meaning beyond the sum of its parts and would not appear as a headword in a dictionary like Oxford. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
