                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'skunk outside' as described does not correspond to a standard English word, phrase, idiom, or phrasal verb that would be included in a reputable dictionary such as Oxford. The use of 'skunk' in this way is not widely recognized and appears to be a rare, context-specific usage, rather than a fixed idiom or commonly used phrase. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
