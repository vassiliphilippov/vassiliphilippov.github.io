                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to 'Wordsworth' as a specific person (William Wordsworth) but the underlying synset is likely just 'person' or 'poet,' which is too general. As a proper noun referring to a specific individual, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a lexical headword (word, phrasal verb, idiom, or compound) in this type of dictionary, unless there is a derived common noun usage (e.g., 'a wordsworth' meaning 'a poet'). Therefore, it should not be included as a primary dictionary entry.</p></div>
