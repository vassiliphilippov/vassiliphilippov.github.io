                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to Erasmus as a 'person' in the sense of a specific individual's proper name. Dictionary headwords of biographical entries are typically only included for people of exceptional historical prominence, sometimes with a brief identifier. However, in this context, the synset is just 'person', which is too generic for inclusion under dictionary guidelines; standard English dictionaries would not have a biographical entry for every person's given name, only select figures as an encyclopedic label. Therefore, this does not qualify as a dictionary concept under the criteria.</p></div>
