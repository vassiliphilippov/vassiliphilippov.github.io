                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Alhazen' here refers to the historical figure, but the synset is a general category for 'person' (i.e., it does not relate specifically to the headword but generically to a type of person). According to filtering criteria, individual people included only if the synset captures their proper noun identity or unique contribution, not a generic class. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
