                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This expression uses 'dyke' (a slang and often offensive term for a lesbian) and is based on a stereotype. The phrase itself is not a standard idiom and is rare, nonstandard, and likely to be considered offensive or inappropriate. It would not appear in respected dictionaries such as the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
