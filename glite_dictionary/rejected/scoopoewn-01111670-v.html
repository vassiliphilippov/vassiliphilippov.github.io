                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'scoop' (meaning 'get the better of') is not sufficiently distinct or common in contemporary English to merit its own dictionary entry; the usage is rare and not widely recognized outside journalistic jargon, and in most cases, more precise terms (such as 'outdo', 'beat', or 'best') are used. Furthermore, 'scoop' as a verb in the sense of 'getting the better of someone' is almost always restricted to the journalistic field (as in 'scoop a rival newspaper'), which is better described by its primary sense of 'publish or report a story before others,' rather than as a general verb meaning 'to surpass' or 'to get the better of'. Therefore, this specific sense does not meet the dictionary inclusion criteria.</p></div>
