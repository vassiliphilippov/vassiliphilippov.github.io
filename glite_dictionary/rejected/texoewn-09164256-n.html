                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept is for 'Tex.' as a shortening, but the main sense is for the state 'Texas', which is the actual dictionary entry. 'Tex.' as an abbreviation does not have significant standalone meaning beyond being an abbreviation of 'Texas', and is not used as a standard word or proper noun on its own. The WordNet POS 'n' here is assigned due to the named entity, but the sense is not independent or meaningful outside of being a short form for 'Texas'. Therefore, according to dictionary criteria, it should not be included as a separate entry.</p></div>
