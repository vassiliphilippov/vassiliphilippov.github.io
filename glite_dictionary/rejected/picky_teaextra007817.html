                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'picky tea' appears to refer to tea that is selective or requires careful preparation, but this is not an established or recognized term in English and does not have widespread conventional usage as a fixed phrase or compound. It is not likely to appear in a reputable dictionary like Oxford or Cambridge. Instead, it appears constructed for this context and is not a standard lexical item.</p></div>
