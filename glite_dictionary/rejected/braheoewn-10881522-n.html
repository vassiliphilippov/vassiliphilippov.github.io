                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is a general label (person) associated with the specific headword 'Brahe'. Dictionary entries only include proper nouns when the definition is more than just the fact of being a personâ€”for example, major historical or cultural figures are included if their fuller significance is stated. In this context, 'Brahe' as a proper noun meaning 'Danish astronomer' does not require a dictionary entry beyond a biographical encyclopedia. It would not have its own headword entry like in the Oxford Dictionary, where only major figures such as 'Tycho Brahe' (full name) would be included as a proper noun entry. The concept as given is too general and is not appropriate for an English-English dictionary entry.</p></div>
