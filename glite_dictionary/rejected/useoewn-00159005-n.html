                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The noun sense of 'use' here, defined as 'exerting shrewd or devious influence especially for one's own advantage,' is too specific and uncommon. The typical noun meanings for 'use' (such as 'the act of using,' 'purpose,' or 'function') are standard in dictionaries, but this manipulative sense is not commonly recognized as a standalone noun usage in major English dictionaries like Oxford or Merriam-Webster. Usage in this sense is rare and often replaced by words like 'manipulation.' Therefore, this concept should not be included as a distinct entry.</p></div>
