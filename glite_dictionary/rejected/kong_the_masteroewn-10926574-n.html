                        <div class='definition'>Chinese philosopher whose ideas and sayings were collected after his death and became the basis of a philosophical doctrine known a Confucianism (circa 551-478 BC)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is for a person ('Chinese philosopher'), and the headword 'Kong the Master' refers to Confucius. Dictionary entries as in the Oxford Dictionary would use 'Confucius' as the standard entry; 'Kong the Master' is not widely recognized or used in English to refer to this philosopher, and the synset is primarily identifying the person, not a unique lexical concept. This does not warrant a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
