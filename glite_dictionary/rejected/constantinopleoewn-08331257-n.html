                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here refers broadly to the ecumenical council as a historical event and is labeled only 'Constantinople', which as a word generally denotes the city. This sense (a council named for its location) is not directly related to the headword as it would be used or looked up by dictionary users. The dictionary would have an entry for 'Constantinople' as a place name (city), and perhaps a separate phrase for 'Council of Constantinople', but not this usage. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
