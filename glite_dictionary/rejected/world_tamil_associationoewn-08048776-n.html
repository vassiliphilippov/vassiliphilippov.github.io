                        <div class='definition'>a terrorist organization in Sri Lanka that began in 1970 as a student protest over the limited university access for Tamil students; currently seeks to establish an independent Tamil state called Eelam; relies on guerilla strategy including terrorist tactics that target key government and military personnel</div>
                        <div class='examples'><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>the Tamil Tigers perfected suicide bombing as a weapon of war</blockquote></div>
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'terrorist organization' is too general relative to the headword 'World Tamil Association.' This entry refers to an organization whose concept is essentially just 'organization' or 'group,' which by itself is too generic for inclusion under these filtering criteria. Additionally, 'World Tamil Association' does not commonly appear in reputable English dictionaries, and is not widely recognized as a headword.</p></div>
