                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Sir Tim Rice' is a proper noun referring to a specific individual, and its sense in WordNet is simply 'person', which is too general. Proper names of individuals are not typically included in standard English dictionaries as headwords unless the person is of extremely significant historical or cultural importance (i.e., their name is used with an additional meaning or as part of another phrase). 'Sir Tim Rice' as a headword does not meet standard inclusion criteria for an English-English dictionary.</p></div>
