                        <div class='definition'>United States actor; husband of Georgiana Emma Barrymore and father of Ethel Barrymore and John Barrymore and Lionel Barrymore (1847-1905)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to 'Barrymore' as a specific person's surname (Maurice Barrymore), but is not itself a commonly used word or proper noun with an independent meaning apart from being a family name for several actors. Dictionary entries typically include only the family name (Barrymore) as a surname or collective noun for the acting family if that has entered common usage, not as an individual person (which should appear as a proper noun entry for the individual, e.g., 'Maurice Barrymore'). Also, this synset is too specific to a particular person and does not represent the headword's general meaning.</p></div>
