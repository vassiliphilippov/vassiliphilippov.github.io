                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'responsibility' refers broadly to the sphere or extent of activities one is in charge of, but the actual example and the primary meaning relates to 'province' or 'domain' as a person's area of duty. 'Responsibility' in standard English does not typically denote 'sphere of activities' as its central or dictionary meaning, and such a sense would not appear as a main or common entry in Oxford or similar dictionaries. Therefore, this specific concept should be excluded.</p></div>
