                        <div class='definition'>English scientist who formulated the law of elasticity and proposed a wave theory of light and formulated a theory of planetary motion and proposed the inverse square law of gravitational attraction and discovered the cellular structure of cork and introduced the term ‘cell’ into biology and invented a balance spring for watches (1635-1703)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is simply 'person', which is too general for dictionary inclusion. While Robert Hooke is a notable historical figure, general biographical entries for individual people are generally not included unless they are eponymous, highly referenced, or have specialized usage beyond their identity as a person; here, the entry would belong in a biographical encyclopedia, not a standard English dictionary.</p></div>
