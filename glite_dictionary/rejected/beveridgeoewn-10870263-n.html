                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is linked to a particular individual (proper noun: Beveridge), and the sense is simply 'person' (albeit with biographical detail). Dictionary entries for proper names like 'Beveridge' would only be included if the person is so renowned that the name is a lexical item or has unique meaning beyond the individual's biography, which is not the case here. Therefore, this concept is too specific and biographical for an English dictionary entry and does not meet the inclusion criteria.</p></div>
