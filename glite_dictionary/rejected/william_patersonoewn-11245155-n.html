                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>William Paterson is a proper noun referring to a specific historical person. The synset here is simply 'person', which is too general and not specialized to this individual. Dictionary entries for people are typically included only for very famous figures with broad cultural impact. In most general English dictionaries (like Oxford), individual historical political figures such as William Paterson do not receive full entries unless they are globally recognized (e.g., George Washington, Napoleon). According to the filtering criteria, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
