                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Casimir Funk' is simply 'person', a generic category rather than a specific sense related to the headword. Proper nouns referring to individuals, whose synset is just 'person', are typically not included in standard English dictionaries like Oxford, except for extremely prominent figures (and even then, usually only with particular relevance to the language or culture). This entry should be excluded.</p></div>
