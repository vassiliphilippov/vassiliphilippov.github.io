                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers specifically to 'Currier' as a person—Nathaniel Currier, with the synset relating to a proper noun (the individual's name) and not to his general occupation, term, or function. Dictionary entries generally do not include every individual person's name unless they have wide significance or become common nouns/adjectives. The Oxford Dictionary would include 'Currier & Ives' as a compound denoting their prints, but not 'Currier' solely as the individual. This entry is excluded as too specific to a person.</p></div>
