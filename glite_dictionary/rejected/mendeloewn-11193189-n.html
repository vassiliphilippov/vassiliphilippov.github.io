                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Mendel' here is the general category of 'person' (a proper noun, name of a historical figure). While Gregor Mendel is historically significant, single personal names of historical figures are typically not included in general purpose English dictionaries as headwords unless their meaning has broadened or shifted, which is not the case here. Comprehensive dictionaries like Oxford generally do not include names unless they have become common nouns or have another established meaning beyond identification of a unique individual.</p></div>
