                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept is a person's full name and its synset is 'person', which is too general. Dictionary entries do not typically include full legal names of people unless they are historical figures of particular note; even so, the primary entry would be under 'Laurel, Stan' as the commonly known name. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
