                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for this concept is a very broad category ('agency') and does not refer to a widely recognized dictionary headword, but rather a specific acronym for a governmental agency. DOEI is not an established term or acronym with general usage outside a narrow context, and would not appear in a standard English dictionary like Oxford except perhaps as an appendix entry for acronyms, which is outside standard word entries.</p></div>
