                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Wynfrith' is simply 'person', which is too general; this is a specific individual's name and would only be included as a PROPN if there is an established dictionary entry as a notable historical or religious figure under that name. However, 'Wynfrith' is much more widely known as 'Saint Boniface', and would more commonly appear as such in English dictionaries. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
