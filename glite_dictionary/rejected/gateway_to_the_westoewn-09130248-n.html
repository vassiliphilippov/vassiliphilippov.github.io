                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to St. Louis, Missouri, but the synonym 'Gateway to the West' is not a standard headword for the city in a dictionaryâ€”it's a nickname or epithet, best explained as a compound phrase or as part of a proper noun entry for St. Louis. Standard dictionaries do not give separate headword entries for city nicknames unless they are extremely widespread and unambiguously linked. This concept is too general as a synset for the city itself and does not justify a separate entry.</p></div>
