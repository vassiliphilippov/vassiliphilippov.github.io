                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Lipscomb' is 'person', which is too general and not specific to the person's historical or scientific notability. Dictionary entries for proper nouns such as people are only included when their significance transcends the individual and has lexicalized meaning; this entry refers only to the individual as a person, which is not dictionary-worthy under standard criteria.</p></div>
