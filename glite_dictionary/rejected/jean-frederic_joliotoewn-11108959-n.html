                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Jean-Frederic Joliot' is 'person', which is too general and not specific to the headword. Individual proper names with only their generic 'person' sense are not included in standard English dictionaries, which focus instead on more widely attested or substantive proper nouns/encyclopedic entries.</p></div>
