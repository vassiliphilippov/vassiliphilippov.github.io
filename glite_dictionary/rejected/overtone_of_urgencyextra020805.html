                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'overtone of urgency' refers to a compositional phrase where the headword 'overtone' is used with the modifier 'of urgency.' This is not an established idiom, compound, or set phrase that would appear as a standalone entry in a dictionary like Oxford; rather, it is a transparent combination of the noun 'overtone' ('suggestion or implication') with a modifying prepositional phrase. The core entry is 'overtone,' and 'of urgency' specifies its context in this use. Therefore, the concept is too specific and compositional and should not be included as its own dictionary entry.</p></div>
