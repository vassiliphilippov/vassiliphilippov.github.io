                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'James Merritt Ives' is simply 'person', which is too general and not specific to this individual's significance. While James Merritt Ives is a notable historical figure, individual names that only carry the general 'person' sense are typically excluded from standard dictionaries such as Oxford, unless they have acquired additional lexical significance or are widely referenced as cultural shorthand. Therefore, this concept should not be included in the dictionary.</p></div>
