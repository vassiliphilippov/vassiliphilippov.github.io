                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'crafted by hand' is a descriptive phrase indicating something is made manually, but it is not an established compound, idiom, or phrasal verb; its meaning is fully transparent and derived from its parts, and it would not appear as a headword or entry in a major English dictionary like Oxford.</p></div>
