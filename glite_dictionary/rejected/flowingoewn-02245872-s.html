                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'flowing' is not widely used as an adjective meaning 'designed or arranged to offer the least resistance to fluid flow'â€”that meaning is typically expressed by the word 'streamlined'. This particular sense would not have its own dictionary entry in a major dictionary like Oxford; it is too specific and not established as a standard word or sense for 'flowing'. The general senses of 'flowing' as an adjective (such as 'flowing hair' or 'flowing water') would be included, but not this technical aerodynamics-oriented sense.</p></div>
