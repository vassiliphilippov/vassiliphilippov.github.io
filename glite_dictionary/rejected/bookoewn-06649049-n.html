                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset describes 'book' as a compilation of records or facts, but this sense overlaps with the broader, primary sense of 'book' as a collection of written or printed sheets. The specific usage 'record book' or the idea of 'book' being a record of known facts does not constitute a distinct dictionary sense for 'book' itself. Instead, this is covered under the general 'book' entry and/or under compounds like 'record book'. Therefore, this concept is too general relative to 'book' and should not be included as a separate sense.</p></div>
