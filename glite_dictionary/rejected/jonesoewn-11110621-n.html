                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers specifically to 'Jones' as a person (Casey Jones), and the synset is essentially 'person' or refers to a named individual. Dictionary entries for ordinary surnames or for people by surname alone (without significant, independent linguistic content) are typically not included unless the term has acquired a secondary meaning or is used as a common noun with a distinct sense. Entries about specific individuals as described here belong in encyclopedias, not general English dictionaries.</p></div>
