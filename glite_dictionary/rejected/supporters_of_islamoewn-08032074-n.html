                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Supporters of Islam' as described refers to an unnamed specific group, with the synset being a general phrase rather than a lexicalized organization name or term. As it is not a widely used proper noun or fixed term that would appear in the Oxford Dictionary, it does not meet inclusion criteria.</p></div>
