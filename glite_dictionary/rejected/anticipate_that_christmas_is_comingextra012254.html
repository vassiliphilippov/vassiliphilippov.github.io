                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'anticipate that Christmas is coming' is a specific phrase that essentially uses the verb 'anticipate' (to look forward to) with respect to Christmas. This is not a set phrase or idiom; instead, it is a standard use of the verb with a particular event. As such, it is too narrow and context-specific to merit its own dictionary entry. The underlying word 'anticipate' is already covered in dictionaries, and the phrase itself does not have an established or special meaning beyond its compositional sense.</p></div>
