                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is 'person', which is too general and not specific to the headword. Biographical entries are only included if the person is of exceptional, world-changing significance. While Edgar Guest was a noted journalist and poet, he does not meet the dictionary's threshold for a headword entry tied to a 'person' synset, and would not be included in a standard English-English dictionary such as Oxford, except possibly in encyclopedias.</p></div>
