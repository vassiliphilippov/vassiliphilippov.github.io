                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to "Falkner" as a proper noun synonymous with "William Faulkner," who is best known under that spelling. The synset is too general (person, specifically the author), and "Falkner" as a headword in this context is not typically included in English dictionaries, as it is only an alternative or historical spelling of "Faulkner." Therefore, it does not meet the inclusion criteria for a dictionary entry under this spelling.</p></div>
