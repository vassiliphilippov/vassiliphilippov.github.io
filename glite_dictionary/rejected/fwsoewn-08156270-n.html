                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'FWS' refers to a specific government agency (Fish and Wildlife Service) and is used as an abbreviation/acronym. While such acronyms might appear in specialist or reference works, general-purpose English dictionaries like Oxford generally only include widely used initialisms. Because 'FWS' is not commonly known among the general public and is a specialist U.S. government term (rather than a general English lexeme), it would not be included as a primary dictionary word.</p></div>
