                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'spill seed' refers to the literal act of dropping seeds while sowing, but there is no evidence that 'spill seed' is a recognized set phrase, idiom, or established phrasal verb in standard English. Its usage as shown is simply the verb 'spill' with 'seed' as its object, which is compositional and not a unique dictionary entry. This phrase does not meet the inclusion criteria for a dictionary entry as found in Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
