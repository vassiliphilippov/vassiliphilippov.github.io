                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'fagtard comment' is essentially a phrase built from two highly offensive slurs. It is not a standardized phrase or idiom that appears in reputable dictionaries, and its meaning is compositional (i.e., simply describes an offensive or derogatory comment using slurs). Therefore, it does not warrant a distinct dictionary entry. Furthermore, the component words are both deeply offensive and inappropriate for inclusion except in well-justified cases such as documenting slurs as individual headwords for educational purposes.</p></div>
