                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a specific person, Anne Bradstreet, and its sense is simply 'poet in colonial America (born in England)', which is a general category (person, poet). Such proper nouns denoting specific people are typically not included as dictionary entries unless the person has become part of the language as a concept or term (e.g., 'Einstein' as a synonym for genius). This sense does not meet that criterion.</p></div>
