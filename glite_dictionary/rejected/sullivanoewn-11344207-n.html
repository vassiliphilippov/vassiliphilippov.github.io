                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for "Sullivan" here is simply 'person', applied as a proper noun for an individual's name. Dictionary entries typically include such names only when they have a strong cultural or historical significance and are not just any person. In this case, 'Sullivan' as a surname is not unique or culturally defining enough on its own to warrant an entry, unless specifically as 'Arthur Sullivan' with notability. Therefore, this specific concept is too general and should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
