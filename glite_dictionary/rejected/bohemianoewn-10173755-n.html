                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'Bohemian' refers to an ethnic group (the Roma people) but the term is considered outdated and problematic in this context. Modern dictionaries discourage using 'Bohemian' to refer to the Romani people, as it can be incorrect and offensive. Instead, the primary meanings of 'Bohemian' relate to the region of Bohemia or a person with an unconventional lifestyle, not an ethnic group. Therefore, this sense should be excluded.</p></div>
