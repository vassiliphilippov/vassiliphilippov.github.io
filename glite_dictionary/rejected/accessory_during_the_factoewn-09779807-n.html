                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'accessory during the fact' is not an established term in English. The legal terms are 'accessory before the fact' and 'accessory after the fact,' but 'accessory during the fact' is not commonly recognized or found in reputable dictionaries. Additionally, the definition given ('a person who witnesses a crime but does not try to prevent it') does not align with standard legal terminology and would not appear as a headword in Oxford Dictionary or similar references.</p></div>
