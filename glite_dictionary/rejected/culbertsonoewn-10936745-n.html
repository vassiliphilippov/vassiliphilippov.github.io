                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Culbertson' in this sense refers specifically to an individual person identified only by surname as an authority on contract bridge (Ely Culbertson). In dictionaries like Oxford, such entries for personal names with only basic biographical information are typically not included, unless the name itself has entered the language as a common noun or has become a term with an independent meaning. Therefore, this concept should be excluded as it is simply a biographical entry and not a dictionary word/phrase.</p></div>
