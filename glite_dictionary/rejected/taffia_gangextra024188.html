                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Taffia gang' refers to a specific group, possibly a proper noun for a named gang. The synset is general ('group associated with loyalty') and does not refer to a recognized lexical headword or set phrase with established usage in English. Named criminal organizations are usually not included as dictionary entries unless they have widespread cultural or historical significance, which 'Taffia gang' does not appear to have. Additionally, without a clear connection to a word or common expression rather than a particular group, this concept falls outside standard dictionary inclusion criteria.</p></div>
