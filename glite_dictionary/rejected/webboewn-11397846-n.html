                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Webb' refers to a person who is identified only by the surname and described as an 'English sociologist and economist and a central member of the Fabian Society (1859-1947)'. Dictionary entries for surnames referring to specific people are generally too broad and not typically included unless the full proper name is widely recognized (e.g., 'William Webb'). Furthermore, this entry's synset is too general for a dictionary entry, as it could refer to any notable person named Webb.</p></div>
