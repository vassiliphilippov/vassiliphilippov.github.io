                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept "know as" with the sense 'look on as or consider' is not a standard English phrasal verb or idiomatic usage; this usage typically appears as 'know someone as something,' which means to be familiar with someone in a particular capacity. However, the examples relate more to 'look on as,' 'think of as,' or 'regard as.' The phrase 'know as' is not commonly used in this sense and would not appear as a dictionary headword in Oxford or similar dictionaries.</p></div>
