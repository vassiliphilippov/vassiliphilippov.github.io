                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase "sit with someone's team" is a compositional and transparent usage, meaning simply to physically or virtually meet and talk with one's colleagues. It is not a fixed expression, idiom, or phrasal verb with a meaning beyond the sum of its parts, nor does it represent a distinct lexical item worthy of a dictionary entry. Such phrases are standard extensions of the meanings of their individual words and would not be found in an Oxford-style dictionary as a headword entry.</p></div>
