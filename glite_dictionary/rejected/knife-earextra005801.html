                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset definition for 'knife-ear' refers to a term for a person who overhears conversations, but this meaning does not appear in standard or widely used English dictionaries, nor is it a commonly recognized English word. It is not attested in reputable sources such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster, and its usage appears to be very rare or idiosyncratic. Therefore, it should not be included in a standard English-English dictionary.</p></div>
