                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Honegger' here refers to the surname of the Swiss composer Arthur Honegger. The synset is for a specific person (proper noun meaning an individual), and unless referring to a highly iconic, household-level individual, such as Shakespeare or Napoleon, surnames of historical figures—especially those not used in wider senses—are typically not included as standalone dictionary entries outside of specialized biographical dictionaries. Therefore, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
