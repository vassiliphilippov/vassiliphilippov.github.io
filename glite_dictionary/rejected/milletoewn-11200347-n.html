                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Millet' here refers only to its status as a person (proper noun: French painter), not to any specific, commonly dictionary-worthy meaning beyond being a person's name. English dictionaries typically do not include proper names as entries unless the person is notable enough and the entry focuses on their historical or cultural significance. While Jean-François Millet is a notable painter, his entry would appear only in biographical dictionaries, encyclopedias, or specialized art dictionaries—not in general English dictionaries like Oxford unless included as a proper noun entry for famous individuals. Standard dictionaries typically do not include surnames unless they designate meanings beyond being a name. Therefore, this sense is excluded.</p></div>
