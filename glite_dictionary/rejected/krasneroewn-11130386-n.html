                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Krasner' is simply 'person', which is too general and does not describe a distinctive lexical concept that would merit a dictionary entry. The name refers to an individual (Lee Krasner), but in dictionaries like Oxford, proper names of people are only included if they are widely used as lexicalized terms or have meanings beyond being a name. This does not apply here.</p></div>
