                        <div class='definition'>a terrorist organization in Sri Lanka that began in 1970 as a student protest over the limited university access for Tamil students; currently seeks to establish an independent Tamil state called Eelam; relies on guerilla strategy including terrorist tactics that target key government and military personnel</div>

                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is incorrectly aligned: 'World Tamil Movement' is described as a terrorist organization in Sri Lanka (actually, that's the 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' or 'Tamil Tigers'), while the actual 'World Tamil Movement' is a Canadian Tamil diaspora organization. This concept reflects a misapplied general synset and should not be included, as its synset is not specifically related to the headword. Thus, it does not meet inclusion criteria for a dictionary.</p></div>
