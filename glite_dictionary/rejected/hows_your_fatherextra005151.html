                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'how's your father' in this sense functions as a literal, compositional question using standard English, rather than an established idiom or fixed expression. It's not a set phrase with a distinct meaning apart from its parts, and thus wouldn't be included as a dictionary entry in Oxford or similar dictionaries unless referencing the unrelated British euphemistic slang meaning. Therefore, it is too general and does not warrant its own dictionary entry.</p></div>
