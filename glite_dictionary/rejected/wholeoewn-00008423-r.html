                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The adverbial use of 'whole' meaning 'completely' or 'entirely' is nonstandard, and in this sense, the standard forms in English are 'wholly,' 'entirely,' 'completely,' or 'altogether.' The provided examples that use 'whole' as an adverb ('a whole new idea') represent informal or colloquial usage as a postmodifier with adjectives, not the core sense 'completely' as in 'wholly.' Therefore, this specific adverbial sense of 'whole' ('to a complete degree; completely') is not standard dictionary headword material.</p></div>
