                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'face a cavalry' appears to be a confusion with 'face a calvary' (which itself is a rare idiomatic usage) or more commonly with 'face one's calvary', referring metaphorically to a period of suffering (from Calvary, the site of Christ's crucifixion). Additionally, the example sentence is likely a typographical or semantic error. 'Face a cavalry' would literally mean to confront a unit of soldiers on horseback, which is not idiomatic or widely used with the sense of 'facing a challenge or hardship'. Therefore, this concept should not be included in the dictionary.</p></div>
