                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'chest proudly lifted' refers to a physical posture or mannerism, but it is not an established idiom, compound, or regularly used phrase in English. It would not appear as a fixed entry in standard dictionaries like Oxford. Instead, it is a descriptive phrase composed of common English words used in a literal or figurative way to describe posture. As such, it is too specific and compositional to merit a dictionary entry.</p></div>
