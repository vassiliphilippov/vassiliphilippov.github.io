                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Israel Strassberg' (known as Lee Strasberg) is 'person', which is too general and does not provide a distinctive dictionary entry beyond noting that this is a proper noun for a specific individual's name. Dictionary entries for personal names are generally not included unless the person is extremely prominent or their name is used as a common noun or adjective (e.g., 'Machiavellian'). This entry does not meet that criterion.</p></div>
