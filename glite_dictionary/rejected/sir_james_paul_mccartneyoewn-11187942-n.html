                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Sir James Paul McCartney' is defined by the synset as merely a 'person' with biographical attributes. While 'Paul McCartney' (the commonly used name) is well-known and would be included in a comprehensive dictionary, the inclusion of the full title 'Sir James Paul McCartney' as a separate entry is unnecessary and not standard for dictionaries like Oxford, which would list the artist under his widely recognized professional name. Therefore, this specific lemma-synset pairing is excluded.</p></div>
