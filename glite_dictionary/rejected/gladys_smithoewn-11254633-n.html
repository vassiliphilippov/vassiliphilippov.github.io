                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset associated with 'Gladys Smith' is simply 'person', which is too general and not specific to her as a distinguishable dictionary entry. While Gladys Smith (better known as Mary Pickford) was a noteworthy actress, dictionary entries for people's names are only included when they refer to individuals with lasting cultural or historical importance under their most commonly recognized name. 'Gladys Smith' is not the commonly used or recognized name for this individual, and as such, should not be included as a stand-alone entry.</p></div>
