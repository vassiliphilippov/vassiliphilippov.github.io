                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Leonard' as 'United States writer of thrillers (born in 1925)' refers to the person Elmore Leonard. As a standalone entry 'Leonard' as a proper noun for a person whose synset is just 'person' is too general and does not warrant an entry under this sense. Only notable surnames or given names with broad usage as common nouns/terms are included, not individual persons unless their name has become a word.</p></div>
