                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset associated with 'Hasdrubal' is simply 'person', which is too general and not directly related to the specific historical figure. Dictionary entries typically only include proper nouns when they refer to unique, non-generic entities with definable characteristics beyond being just a 'person'. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
