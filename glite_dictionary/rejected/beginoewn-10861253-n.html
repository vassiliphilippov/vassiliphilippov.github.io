                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is 'Israeli statesman' (Menachem Begin), with the headword 'Begin'. This is a reference to a specific person, and as such, the synset is an instance of 'person', which is too general and not appropriate for a dictionary entry unless it has additional semantic content beyond being a proper noun. Dictionary entries typically include proper nouns only if they are widely recognized or have broader usage; however, this reference is simply biographical and does not require a separate entry under 'Begin' distinct from encyclopedic content. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
