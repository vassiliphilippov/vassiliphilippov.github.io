                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is too general (organization), referring to the entity as an organization rather than as the specific group identified as 'Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.' Dictionary entries typically include either well-known proper nouns/groups or words whose meanings are more than just 'organization.' As this concept does not have an independent established identity in English dictionaries beyond being classified as an organization, it should be excluded.</p></div>
