                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept represents a generic, compositional phrase that simply means to do something in one's own manner, combining standard words with their usual meanings. It does not have an idiomatic or special usage distinct from the meanings of "do," "it," and the possessive "one's." Such phrases are not included in major dictionaries like Oxford, as they are fully predictable based on the meanings of their components.</p></div>
