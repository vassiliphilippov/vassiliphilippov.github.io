                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept represents a figurative or literary sense of 'light' as an expression of merriment or liveliness in someone's eyes or face. However, this is a specific metaphorical use rather than a distinct dictionary-worthy sense of 'light' as a noun. Standard dictionaries include definitions like 'a brightness' or 'something that makes things visible,' but not the particular figurative sense described here. This is too narrow and not commonly treated as a stand-alone sense in major dictionaries.</p></div>
