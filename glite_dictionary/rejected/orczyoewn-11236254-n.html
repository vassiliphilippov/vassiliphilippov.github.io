                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Orczy' is too general, referring simply to a person (a named individual, Baroness Orczy). Dictionary entries typically include names of famous writers as proper nouns only if they are widely referenced as cultural or literary figures beyond biographical mention. While Baroness Orczy is notable, standard dictionaries would typically not include 'Orczy' as a headword but would instead have an entry under 'Baroness Orczy' or perhaps 'Emma Orczy'. Additionally, the sense here is simply 'person' or 'writer', rather than a unique lexical item. Therefore, per guidelines, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
