                        <div class='definition'>Dutch humanist and theologian who was the leading Renaissance scholar of northern Europe; although his criticisms of the Roman Catholic Church led to the Reformation, he opposed violence and condemned Martin Luther (1466-1536)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Gerhard Gerhards' refers to a specific person, but the sense given is that of 'person', which is too general to merit inclusion as a distinct dictionary entry. 'Gerhard Gerhards' is the birth name of Erasmus, and biographical names are only included if they have standalone relevance or common use in English; in this case, the individual is universally known by the name 'Erasmus', not 'Gerhard Gerhards'.</p></div>
