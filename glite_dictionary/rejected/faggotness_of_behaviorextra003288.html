                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'faggotness of behavior' is constructed from the highly offensive slur 'faggot' and is not a standard or recognized term in English. Additionally, its use is inherently derogatory and not suitable for inclusion as a headword in a dictionary like Oxford. Dictionaries generally do not include nonce formations based on slurs, especially those describing abstract qualities, unless they have significant, attested, and notable usageâ€”which this does not. The concept is excluded on the basis that it is both a nonstandard phrase and built upon an offensive term, rather than being a central, established word or phrase.</p></div>
