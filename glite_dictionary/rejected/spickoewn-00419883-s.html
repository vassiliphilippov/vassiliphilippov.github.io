                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'spick' as meaning 'completely neat and clean' only appears as part of the compound 'spick-and-span' or possibly as a base in very rare compound words. 'Spick' by itself is not used in modern English to mean 'neat and clean.' Including 'spick' with this meaning is misleading, as it does not appear independently with this sense in contemporary usage. The proper entry for this sense is 'spick-and-span.'</p></div>
