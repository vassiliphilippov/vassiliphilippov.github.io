                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here refers to a person (Severo Ochoa) and is defined only as 'United States biochemist (born in Spain)'. Naming an individual person as simply 'person' is too general and not suitable for a dictionary entry under this guideline. Oxford Dictionary typically does not include every proper noun for people who are not highly prominent or whose name does not have additional meanings or usages in English. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
