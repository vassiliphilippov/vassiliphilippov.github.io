                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'do work' as 'be employed' is adequately covered under the main verb 'work' in standard dictionaries. The phrase 'do work' is not an established phrasal verb or set phrase with its own idiomatic meaning; it simply consists of the verb 'do' + the noun 'work.' Therefore, there is no need to include 'do work' as a separate entry, as its meaning is compositional and general.</p></div>
