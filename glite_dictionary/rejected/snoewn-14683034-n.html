                        <div class='definition'>a silvery malleable metallic element that resists corrosion; used in many alloys and to coat other metals to prevent corrosion; obtained chiefly from cassiterite where it occurs as tin oxide</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Sn' refers to the chemical symbol for 'tin', but as a lemma, 'Sn' is an abbreviation rather than a word, and its synset is too general (referring to the element itself, which is properly entered under 'tin'). Dictionaries like Oxford would list 'tin' as the headword, with a note 'symbol: Sn'; the symbol itself does not have a full dictionary entry outside of a list of chemical elements. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
