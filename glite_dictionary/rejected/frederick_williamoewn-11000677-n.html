                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although 'Frederick William' refers to a specific historical figure, the synset given ('the Elector of Brandenburg who rebuilt his domain...') is overly specific to an individual, and as a proper noun, it does not have a generalizable meaning beyond being the name of a person. As per dictionary standards like Oxford, only widely recognized proper names with sustained lexical significance or significance beyond an individual's biography are included. This entry does not qualify, as it's simply a person's name with a detailed identifier, not a term with an independent meaning.</p></div>
