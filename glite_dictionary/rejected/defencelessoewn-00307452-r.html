                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'defenceless' is being presented here as an adverb ('defencelessly'), but 'defenceless' itself is an adjective and should be included as such. The adverb 'defencelessly' is derived, but as an adverb, it is extremely rare and not a standard headword for dictionaries. The adjective 'defenceless' would be included, but not the adverbial sense as presented here.</p></div>
