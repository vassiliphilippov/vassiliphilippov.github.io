                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is 'person', referring to J. William Fulbright as an individual. Dictionary entries typically do not include people unless the person is so famous that their name becomes a common noun or eponym (e.g., 'Sandwich'), or if there is a distinct sense beyond the general category of 'person'. In this case, it is simply referring to Fulbright as a person, not as an eponym or term with wider use. Thus, it should be excluded.</p></div>
