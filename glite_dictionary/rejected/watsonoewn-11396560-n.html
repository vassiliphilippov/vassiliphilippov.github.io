                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Watson' here is defined as 'person,' focusing solely on his identity as an assistant/engineer rather than any widely used proper noun sense, term, or notable phrase. This is a biographical reference specific to WordNet, not a sense commonly included in general English dictionaries. Such entries about individuals are only included if the person is widely known by a single name or title and their notability is exceptional (e.g., 'Einstein' as a household name). 'Watson' in this context does not meet those criteria.</p></div>
