                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to Salisbury as the capital and largest city of Zimbabwe, but the city is now officially named Harare. The use of 'Salisbury' for this city is historical and not current; the entry as a city name is too general or outdated for inclusion as a primary sense in a modern general-purpose English dictionary. The primary senses of 'Salisbury' refer to the city in England or the former sense for Harare, which would be included only as a historical reference, not as the main entry for the capital of Zimbabwe.</p></div>
