                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'spergy comment' is derived from 'spergy', which itself is an offensive slang term related to 'Asperger's syndrome' or autistic traits. It is a highly informal and offensive slang term that is not appropriate for inclusion in a standard English-English dictionary, especially as a collocation with 'comment'. It is not an established phrase that would appear as a dictionary entry in Oxford or similar dictionaries. Including it could perpetuate stigma and would not be educationally or socially responsible.</p></div>
