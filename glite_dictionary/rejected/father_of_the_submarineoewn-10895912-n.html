                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is a generic descriptor or epithet ('Father of the Submarine') used to refer to a person (David Bushnell) based on his achievements. Such epithets, when not widely used as established compound proper nouns or set phrases, are too specific and referential for standard dictionaries. The concept refers to a person (an inventor), so it is filtered out according to the inclusion guidelines.</p></div>
