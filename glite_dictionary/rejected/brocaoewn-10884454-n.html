                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Broca' in this context refers to a person ('French anthropologist') rather than a word with a unique lexical meaning in English. Biographical entries for people are not included unless the name has developed independent lexical significance, such as an eponym for something else (e.g., 'Broca's area'). This entry should be excluded as it refers specifically to the person Paul Broca, not a dictionary headword.</p></div>
