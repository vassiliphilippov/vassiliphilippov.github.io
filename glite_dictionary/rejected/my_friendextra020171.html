                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept "my friend" here is a generic use, not a distinct lexical item with a special idiomatic meaning or specific colloquial usage. It is simply a possessive pronoun plus a common noun, not a standalone headword or fixed phrase that would be found as an entry in a dictionary like Oxford. The sense does not refer to an idiomatic, slang, or unique usage; hence, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
