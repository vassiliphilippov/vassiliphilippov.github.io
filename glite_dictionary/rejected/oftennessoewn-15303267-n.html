                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>While 'oftenness' is a grammatically possible noun, it is extremely rare and not commonly accepted or attested in reputable dictionaries such as Oxford. The standard term for this concept is 'frequency,' which is universally used and recognized in both general and technical contexts. 'Oftenness' does not warrant inclusion as it would not be expected in a serious English dictionary.</p></div>
