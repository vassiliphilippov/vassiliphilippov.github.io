                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The provided synset is a general organization label for the 'First of October Antifascist Resistance Group,' not a specific meaning distinct from its role as a proper noun. Such organizations are typically included in encyclopedias rather than general English dictionaries like Oxford, unless they have become common terms in English with meanings beyond the original entity. This entry remains a proper noun designating a specific group, and its meaning does not diverge from being simply the name of that group.</p></div>
