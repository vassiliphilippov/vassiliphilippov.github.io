                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'in both ears' as used here refers to a technical, adverbial use describing the manner in which sound is presented (binaurally). However, this is not an idiomatic phrase or set expression in English, nor does it represent a lexicalized adverbial entry. Instead, it is a standard prepositional phrase whose meaning is transparent and compositional. Such constructions are not typically included in English dictionaries as headwords, unless they have a non-literal, idiomatic usage, which is not the case here.</p></div>
