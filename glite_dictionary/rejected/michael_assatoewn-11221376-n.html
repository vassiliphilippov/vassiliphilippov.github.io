                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Michael Assat' refers generally to a named individual (a proper noun), and its linked synset is simply 'person', which is too general. Dictionary entries typically do not include individual persons unless they are extremely notable and have specialized meanings outside their identity as a person. Furthermore, this kind of biographical entry is not typical for an English-English dictionary such as the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
