                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is referring to James Riddle Hoffa as a 'person' (individual), which is too general for a dictionary entry. While notable, dictionary entries for such proper nouns typically require additional lexical relevance (such as words that have taken on extended meaning beyond the individual, or have become common nouns themselves). Standard dictionaries, such as the Oxford Dictionary, usually do not include biographical entries for famous people unless their names have developed additional, non-referential senses. Therefore, this specific concept should be excluded.</p></div>
