                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'all rumors are true' is a compositional sentence rather than an idiom, set phrase, or fixed expression with a distinct meaning. It does not have a lexicalized, non-compositional meaning and is not recognized as a set phrase that would appear in a major learner's dictionary such as Oxford. Therefore, it should not be included as a standalone dictionary entry.</p></div>
