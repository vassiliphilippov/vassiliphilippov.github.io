                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense refers to 'engineering' as a room on a ship where the engine is located, but this is not an established or common meaning for 'engineering' as a noun. The correct term for such a room is typically 'engine room'. This usage would not appear as an entry for 'engineering' in major English dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster, which define 'engineering' in terms of the profession or discipline of designing and building.</p></div>
