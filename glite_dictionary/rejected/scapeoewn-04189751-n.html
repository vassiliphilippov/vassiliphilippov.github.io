                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'scape' refers to a highly technical and archaic architectural term that is not commonly recognized in modern English usage and is excessively specialized. It does not appear as a main entry or sub-entry in major dictionaries like Oxford, as the headword 'scape' is not commonly used for the vertical part of a column (that would be 'shaft'). Including it would not benefit most learners, as it is obscure and not in general or even specialist architectural use today.</p></div>
