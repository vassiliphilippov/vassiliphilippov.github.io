                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is a descriptive phrase ('rapacious businessman') rather than an established compound or fixed term that would appear as a separate entry in major dictionaries. It is a straightforward combination of 'rapacious' and 'businessman', both of which are standard dictionary words. Such adjective + noun phrases are not included as standalone dictionary entries unless they have a specific, widely recognized meaning distinct from their parts. Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
