                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to Lucille Ball as a specific person, and while proper nouns of notable people can sometimes be included in general dictionaries, this entry is too general (simply 'Ball' with synset 'person') and does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a dictionary headword. Dictionaries typically do not include person synsets for surnames unless the person is extremely prominent and the full name is the headword. 'Ball' here as a surname does not have a unique general lexical meaning outside the proper noun.</p></div>
