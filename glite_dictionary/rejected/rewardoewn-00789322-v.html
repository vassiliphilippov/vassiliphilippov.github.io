                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The WordNet synset here links the verb 'reward' to the more general meaning of 'strengthen and support with rewards', which is more accurately described by words like 'reinforce' or 'encourage'. While 'reward' as a verb (to give something in recognition of service, effort, or achievement) is certainly dictionary-worthy, this particular synset is a generic, explanatory framing rather than a distinct sense of the verb 'reward'. There is no unique dictionary entry for 'reward' specifically meaning 'to strengthen and support with rewards'; it falls under the broader and already covered meaning of 'to give a reward'. Therefore, this specific concept does not require a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
