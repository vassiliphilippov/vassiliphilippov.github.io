                        <div class='definition'>a terrorist organization whose goal is to take over Japan and then the world; based on a religion founded in 1987 that combines elements of Buddhism with Christianity</div>

                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'Supreme Truth' refers to an organization, but as described here, its synset is generic as a 'terrorist organization' or 'organization', not a specific proper noun entry connected directly to 'Supreme Truth'. Such organization names are often more encyclopedic and would not have standard dictionary entries unless extremely notable; however, the organization is better known as 'Aum Shinrikyo', which does warrant inclusion under that headword, not as 'Supreme Truth'. Therefore, this concept does not fit as a dictionary entry under 'Supreme Truth'.</p></div>
