                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'refer to as lordship' is an overly specific phrasing describing an action (addressing someone as 'lordship'), not an established phrasal verb, idiom, or dictionary-worthy headword. The underlying useful entry would be 'lordship' as a noun, which is already included in major dictionaries. Therefore, this concept does not merit its own entry.</p></div>
