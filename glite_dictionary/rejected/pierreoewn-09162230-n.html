                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Pierre' in this sense refers to a specific city, and its synset in this context simply identifies it as a place (capital of South Dakota). As a proper noun for a geographical location, unless there is pronounced lexical significance beyond being a place name, most general dictionaries include only major world cities or capitals of nations, but not all US state capitals unless there is substantial cultural or linguistic usage beyond its role as a place name. Given these guidelines and the dictionary's scope, 'Pierre' as the capital of South Dakota would not typically be included except in encyclopedic reference works.</p></div>
