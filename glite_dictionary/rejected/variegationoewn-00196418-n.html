                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The WordNet sense for 'variegation' here is actually about the act of introducing variety in investments or goods/services, which is far more commonly and properly called 'diversification'. The use of 'variegation' with this meaning is very rare in standard English. The lemma 'variegation' is usually used for pattern/color (e.g., variegation in plant leaves). Therefore, this sense should not be included as a main dictionary entry for 'variegation'â€”it is not standard, and the synset is not properly related to the headword as dictionary users would expect.</p></div>
