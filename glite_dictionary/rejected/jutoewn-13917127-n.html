                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to the concept of 'jut' as a noun meaning something that bulges out or projects from its surroundings. However, 'jut' is rarely or never used as a noun in contemporary English in this sense. The commonly used noun forms for this concept are 'bulge,' 'hump,' 'prominence,' or 'protuberance.' 'Jut' as a verb (to stick out) is dictionary-worthy, but the noun form is not in standard usage and would not appear as a main headword in Oxford or similar dictionaries.</p></div>
