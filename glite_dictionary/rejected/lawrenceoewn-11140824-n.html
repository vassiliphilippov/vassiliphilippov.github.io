                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is connected to the person 'Lawrence' but is too general, referencing the proper noun in a context that would not typically appear as an independent dictionary entry, except as part of a biographical or encyclopedic article (e.g. 'T. E. Lawrence'). Dictionary entries usually do not include given names tied to a profession or a short description unless the person is extremely prominent, in which case the full name or a widely known title would be an entry. 'Lawrence' alone in this context does not meet Oxford Dictionary criteria for a usable headword entry unless as a surname or given name, or as 'Lawrence of Arabia'.</p></div>
