                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'woman among women' refers to a person (a woman) who stands out or is notable among a group of women, but it is not a fixed phrase, idiom, or compound recognized in standard dictionaries. It does not have a distinct, established meaning separate from the literal interpretation of its words. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
