                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Edward the Martyr' is simply a specific instance of a person (a historical figure) and does not pertain to a general sense of the word or phrase, but rather to a proper noun referring to one individual. While important historically, such biographical entries for individuals are generally excluded from dictionaries like Oxford unless they have become common nouns or adjectives with wider use. Therefore, this concept should be filtered out.</p></div>
