                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Agrippa' is primarily functioning as a proper noun indicating a historical person and is defined as 'Roman general...' This is a specific person (Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa) and not a general noun or distinct term with a lexical sense beyond referring to this individual. In standard dictionaries like Oxford, only particularly prominent historical figures or those who have become terms in their own right are included. 'Agrippa' as simply a proper name of a person is too general and is not included as a general word or dictionary entry.</p></div>
