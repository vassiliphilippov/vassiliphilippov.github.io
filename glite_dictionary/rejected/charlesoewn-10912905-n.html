                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is too general (refers only to 'person') and the concept describes an individual person (a proper noun, a historical figure); inclusion of such proper names is generally limited in standard English dictionaries unless the name has become an established word or has significant secondary meanings. This specific historical person (Charles VII of France) would not typically appear under 'Charles' as a dictionary entry in standard English dictionaries.</p></div>
