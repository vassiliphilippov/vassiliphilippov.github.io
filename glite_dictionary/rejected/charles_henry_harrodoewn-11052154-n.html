                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Charles Henry Harrod' is a generic person, referring to a specific individual's name. In line with the guidelines, individual historical person's names that are not used as common nouns or compounds (such as 'Harrod's' meaning the store) are typically excluded from general English dictionaries like Oxford. Proper nouns referring solely to individuals do not warrant inclusion unless they have acquired additional meanings or significance beyond the person.</p></div>
