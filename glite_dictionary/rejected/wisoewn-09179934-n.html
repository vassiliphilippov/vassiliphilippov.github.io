                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Wis.' is an abbreviation for 'Wisconsin', which is a proper noun and the name of a U.S. state. As a dictionary headword, 'Wis.' as an abbreviation for the state is not usually included as a primary entry (such abbreviations are typically listed as sub-entries under the main state name or in specialized abbreviation lists, not in main Oxford-style definitions). Furthermore, as an abbreviation, it does not have a distinct meaning beyond being a shortened form and is not a lexical item in its own right connected to a specific synset beyond 'state'. Therefore, it is excluded from the dictionary as per instructions.</p></div>
