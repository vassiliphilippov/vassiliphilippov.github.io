                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'King of Swing' refers to a person, specifically the nickname for Benny Goodman. Since the sense is linked to 'person' rather than a unique lexical meaning, and is not sufficiently distinct from the proper noun itself, it does not warrant a separate dictionary entry. Nicknames of famous individuals are typically included under the person's entry, not as standalone headwords in general dictionaries.</p></div>
