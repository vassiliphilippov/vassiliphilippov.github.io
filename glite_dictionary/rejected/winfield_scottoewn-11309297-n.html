                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>'Winfield Scott' as a concept refers to a specific historical person (proper noun), and its WordNet synset is simply 'person' (a general category not specific to this entry). Dictionary entries for full names of notable people are not typically included unless their name has a meaning beyond just referring to the person, such as an eponym or derived term. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
