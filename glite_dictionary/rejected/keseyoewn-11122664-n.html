Such entries, being proper names of individuals whose definitions are general (such as writer, scientist, etc.), are excluded under the provided guidelines. Encyclopedic entries for notable individuals are not typically included in general-purpose English-English dictionaries like Oxford unless the person is extremely culturally significant and the name has taken on a broader associative meaning.</p></div>
