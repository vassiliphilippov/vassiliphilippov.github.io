                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Eleanor of Aquitaine' is simply 'person,' which is too general and not specific to the headword. While she is a well-known historical figure, the dictionary entry would just be her biographical information, which typically is not included in standard dictionaries unless the person has become a cultural touchstone or generic term (e.g., 'Einstein' as a synonym for 'genius'). Therefore, per the guidelines, this should be excluded.</p></div>
