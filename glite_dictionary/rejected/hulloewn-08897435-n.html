                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to Hull as a large fishing port in northeastern England, but the synset is overly general; it is covered by the proper noun 'Hull' (short for 'Kingston upon Hull'), which would be entered as a place name/proper noun. Such generic place name senses (as 'port' or 'city') are not typically included apart from the proper noun entry in standard general English dictionaries like Oxford; the entry would focus on factual description of the town, not just its classification as a port or city.</p></div>
