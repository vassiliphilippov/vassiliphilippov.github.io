                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense described refers to a historical nickname ('Johnny' or 'greyback') specifically applied to Confederate soldiers, but the headword 'Rebel' here does not refer to a general noun entry, nor is this nickname in common use or sufficiently distinctive from the main sense of 'rebel' (a person who resists authority). Since Oxford and standard dictionaries cover 'rebel' for its common meanings, but not for this specialized, nickname use (which is better covered under 'Johnny Reb' or 'greyback'), this usage is too specialized and historical for the main entry 'rebel'. Thus, it should be excluded.</p></div>
