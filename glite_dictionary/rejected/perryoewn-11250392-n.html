                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to 'Perry' in the sense of a specific person's surname (Commodore Matthew Perry), described as 'United States admiral...'; as such, the synset relates to the general category of 'person' (proper noun). This is too general for inclusion as a dictionary entry, since dictionary entries for 'Perry' would either be as a surname or a common noun (the drink 'perry'), not as a label for this person. Biographical entries by name unless extremely prominent and the sense is unique (e.g., 'Shakespeare') are not typically included in standard dictionaries, and the synset is not unique to this person but a family/proper name. Therefore, it is excluded.</p></div>
