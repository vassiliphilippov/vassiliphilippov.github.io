                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'son of a bachelor' is a descriptive phrase, not a set idiom, established compound, or common term. It refers simply to someone whose father was unmarried at the time of their birth, but it does not have an independently recognized lexical status or idiomatic meaning, nor would it appear as a headword in major English dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster.</p></div>
