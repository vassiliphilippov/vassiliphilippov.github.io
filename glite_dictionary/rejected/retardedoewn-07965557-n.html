                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to a group of people collectively ('the retarded') using a term that is now widely considered offensive and inappropriate to refer to individuals with intellectual disabilities. Modern dictionaries either do not include this as an independent noun for people, or label it as highly offensive, archaic, or obsolete. The term is no longer used in medical, educational, or polite contexts. Therefore, it should not be included as a headword meaning 'people who are mentally retarded' in a modern English dictionary.</p></div>
