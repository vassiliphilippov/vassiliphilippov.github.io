                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'issue' as 'a phenomenon that follows and is caused by some previous phenomenon' is too broad and general; it does not represent a standard, recognizable usage of the word 'issue' as seen in reputable dictionaries. In this context, words like 'consequence,' 'result,' or 'effect' are appropriate, but 'issue' is not clearly used in modern or common English this way. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
