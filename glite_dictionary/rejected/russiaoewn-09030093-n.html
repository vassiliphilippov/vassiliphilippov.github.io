                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The given sense essentially refers to 'Russia' as a geographical and political entity ('formerly the largest Soviet Socialist Republic in the USSR'), which is a specific sense that is subsumed by the general entry for 'Russia' as a proper noun. However, as a proper noun designating a country, it is not appropriate to create a distinct entry for this deprecated, historical sense as a separate dictionary headword. Such a meaning would be better included under the main entry for 'Russia' with a note on historical usage, rather than a separate dictionary definition. Since this is just the country name used in a particular historical period, it is too general to be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
