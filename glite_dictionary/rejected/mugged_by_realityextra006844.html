                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'mugged by reality' is not a widely established idiom or fixed phrase in English usage. It resembles a metaphorical extension of 'mugged' but is not idiomatic or commonly found in major dictionaries such as Oxford. Its appearance is sporadic and appears to be a creative, informal usage rather than a stable entry. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
