                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Siraj-ud-daula' is simply 'person,' which is too general and not specific to this historical figure. According to the filtering criteria, concepts that have a synset not directly about the headword but are instead overly general (such as 'person' for a proper noun) are to be excluded.</p></div>
