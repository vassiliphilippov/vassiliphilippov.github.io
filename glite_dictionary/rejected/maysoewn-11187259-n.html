                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Mays' with the synset 'United States baseball player (born in 1931)' is referential and functions as a proper noun relating to a specific person (Willie Mays). Dictionaries like Oxford typically do not include such proper nouns unless they are highly prominent figures with broad cultural or historical significance. Even in such cases, biographical entries are rare outside of specialized biographical compendia. Therefore, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
