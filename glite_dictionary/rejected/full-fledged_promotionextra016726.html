                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'full-fledged promotion' is a phrase composed of an adjective ('full-fledged') modifying the common noun 'promotion.' This is a compositional phrase rather than a fixed compound or idiom with a unique meaning. It is not a lexicalized entry found in major English dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster, and its meaning is transparently derived from its parts. Thus, according to the criteria, it should not be included as a standalone dictionary entry.</p></div>
