                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to the plural noun 'hands' specifically as part of the idiomatic prepositional phrase 'in (someone's) hands', meaning 'under someone's control or care'. The core sense is not the general noun 'hands', but a figurative phrase using 'hands' as a metaphor for possession, care, or guardianship. Such phraseological senses are typically entered under fixed or semi-fixed expressions like 'in someone's hands' or 'in the hands of', not under the basic noun 'hands'. Including this as a definition for just 'hands' would be misleading and too broad for a dictionary entry. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a standalone entry for 'hands'.</p></div>
