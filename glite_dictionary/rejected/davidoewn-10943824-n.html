                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The given synset is 'person', which is too general and refers to the individual 'David'. Dictionary entries for proper nouns such as personal names should only be included if the person is exceptionally prominent and the name itself is often used as a cultural reference point or in set phrases. 'David' alone as a personal name, identified just as 'French neoclassical painter', does not meet this criteria; it serves as a biographical entry rather than a dictionary definition. Most English dictionaries would have an entry for 'David' as a common given name or for the biblical King David, but not for the painter as a general headword on its own.</p></div>
