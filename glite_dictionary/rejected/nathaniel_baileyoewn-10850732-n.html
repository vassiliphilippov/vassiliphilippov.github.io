                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset associated with 'Nathaniel Bailey' is a specific person, and the concept is a biographical entry that would not be included as a dictionary headword in a general English-English dictionary. Such entries are more appropriate for encyclopedias than for a dictionary like the Oxford Dictionary. The definition is simply identifying an individual and does not provide a broader, lexical sense relevant to the term's usage in language.</p></div>
