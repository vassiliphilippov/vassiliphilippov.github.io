                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Duchesse de Valentinois' is mainly 'person'â€”a highly general category. As such, the lemma does not refer to an independently meaningful concept in English beyond being a historical title or person. Biographical entries of historical figures may appear in encyclopedias but are generally excluded from standard dictionaries unless the name has entered the language as a title, concept, or has secondary metaphorical use. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
