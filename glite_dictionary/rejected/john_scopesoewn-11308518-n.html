                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'John Scopes' is 'person', which is too general and not specific to the headword. While John Scopes is a historically notable person, the dictionary only includes proper nouns of enduring general usage or technical importance. Most comprehensive English learner dictionaries (e.g., Oxford) would not include individual historical figures unless they are of exceptional, lasting global impact. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
