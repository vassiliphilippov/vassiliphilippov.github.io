                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept "she'd have won" is a regular contraction and combination of the pronoun 'she', the auxiliary 'would', and the perfect aspect 'have', plus the past participle of 'win'. This contracted form is systematic and understandable from the meanings of its parts, and is not a distinct dictionary entry as found in standard dictionaries such as Oxford. Contractions like "she'd" (she would/had) are included, but not full phrasal combinations like "she'd have won".</p></div>
