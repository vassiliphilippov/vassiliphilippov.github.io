                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Carson' refers to a specific person (Rachel Carson) but is presented here as a general proper noun 'person,' which is too broad. Dictionary entries for proper nouns like this are typically only included if the person's name is commonly used as a general term or idiom, or the individual is universally significant for language learners. In this context, 'Carson' as a proper noun denoting a person does not meet that threshold for inclusion in a general dictionary, and its synset is too general.</p></div>
