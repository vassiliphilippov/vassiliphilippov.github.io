                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This phrase is not a common idiom in standard English and is not widely attested in reputable dictionaries such as Oxford or Merriam-Webster. The expression appears obscure, and its meaning (to interfere or intrude in someone's affairs) overlaps with more established idioms. Since it is unlikely to be encountered by most learners and is not a lexically established unit, it should be excluded from the dictionary.</p></div>
