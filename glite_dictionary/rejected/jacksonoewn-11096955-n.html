                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is 'person' and the entry 'Jackson' in this sense refers specifically to Michael Jackson (proper noun, person). While 'Jackson' as a surname is dictionary-worthy, a dictionary typically would not include a sense line for individual persons under the headword 'Jackson'â€”instead, there would be a biographical entry for 'Michael Jackson' as a proper noun, not for the standalone 'Jackson' in the context of an individual.</p></div>
