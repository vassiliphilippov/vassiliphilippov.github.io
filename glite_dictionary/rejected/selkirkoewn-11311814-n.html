                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is simply 'person', and 'Selkirk' as a biographical entry of a historical figure only fits dictionary criteria if the person is of significant cultural or linguistic relevance beyond an encyclopedic mention. Standard learnersâ€™ dictionaries (such as Oxford) typically do not include individual historical figures unless their name has taken on a wider meaning or usage in English. Here, 'Selkirk' refers to Alexander Selkirk, best known as inspiration for Robinson Crusoe, but his name is not commonly used in English as a word or phrase beyond referring to the individual. Therefore, this entry should be excluded.</p></div>
