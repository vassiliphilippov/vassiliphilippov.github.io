                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'William Styron' is a general person/proper noun (a specific individual's name), and dictionary entries typically only include people if their name has acquired a common noun or figurative meaning, or if they are extraordinarily significant. Most dictionaries do not include ordinary biographical proper nouns unless the person is extremely influential and their name is often referenced. This entry also does not have further meaning beyond the person, so it should be excluded.</p></div>
