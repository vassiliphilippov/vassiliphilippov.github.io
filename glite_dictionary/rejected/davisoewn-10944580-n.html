                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'United States jazz musician' refers to 'Davis' as a person (Miles Davis). Proper nouns referring exclusively to individuals, where the synset is just 'person' or 'musician,' are not suitable for a general dictionary entry unless the individual is especially significant and treated as a reference entry in major dictionaries (like Oxford). Generally, standard English dictionaries do not include proper nouns for persons unless their names have become common nouns or phrases, or unless they are extremely historically significant and widely referenced. Here, 'Davis' in this sense would not appear as a dictionary entry; it is an encyclopedic entry.</p></div>
