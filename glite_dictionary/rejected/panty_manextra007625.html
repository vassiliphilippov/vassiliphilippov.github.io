                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'panty man' is an informal or slang compound based on 'panty' and 'man,' referring to a person with a peculiar or potentially inappropriate interest in women's underwear. While such a phrase might be used colloquially or in gossip, it does not appear as a set phrase or established term in standard dictionaries like Oxford. Its synset is too specific and also potentially describes behavior rather than an established lexical item. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion.</p></div>
