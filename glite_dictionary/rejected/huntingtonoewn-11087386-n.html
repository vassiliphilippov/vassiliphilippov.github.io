                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Huntington' here is a specific person's surname referring to Samuel Huntington, labeled only as 'person' and primarily known as a historical proper name. Dictionary entries for surnames derived solely from individuals' names (and not also carrying common-noun meaning) are usually not included in general English-language dictionaries like Oxford unless the surname itself has broad, non-person-related meaning or is extremely notable as a cultural reference. This is too specific and does not meet the inclusion criteria.</p></div>
