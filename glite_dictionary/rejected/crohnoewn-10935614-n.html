                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Crohn' here refers to a person's surname (Burrill Crohn) with the general synset 'person'. Dictionary entries for individual persons are only included if they are sufficiently well-known as proper nouns or have independent usage beyond acting as biographical names. 'Crohn' alone is not used outside the context of 'Crohn's disease' or as a biographical entry; therefore, it does not warrant a main headword entry in a standard dictionary of English.</p></div>
