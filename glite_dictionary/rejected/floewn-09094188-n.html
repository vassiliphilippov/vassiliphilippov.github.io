                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>FL in this context refers to the abbreviation for the state of Florida, but the synset is for the general category of a state. As an abbreviation, 'FL' would be included as a dictionary entry only if specifically referring to the state's postal abbreviation or common shortening. However, the synset here is not about the abbreviation itself, but about the concept of a U.S. state. Therefore, this concept is too general and not specific to 'FL' as an abbreviation, so it should be excluded.</p></div>
