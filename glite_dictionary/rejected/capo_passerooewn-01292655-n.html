                        <div class='definition'>a naval battle in the Mediterranean Sea off Cape Passero in which the Spanish navy was destroyed by France and England while attempting to recover Sicily and Sardinia from Italy (1719)</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a specific historical event (a naval battle) named after a place, not to the place itself (Capo Passero). The dictionary should focus on entries for notable battles only if their names are established terms in English. 'Capo Passero' as a naval battle is not commonly used as a standard dictionary entry in its own right; it is too specific and not widely recognized outside specialized historical texts.</p></div>
