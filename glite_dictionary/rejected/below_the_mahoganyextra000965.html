                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'below the mahogany' is not a broadly recognized English idiom or standard phrase appearing in major dictionaries. Its reported meaning is obscure, nontransparent, and does not have clear, established usage in English corpora. It seems too rare or possibly context-specific to be included in a general purpose English-English dictionary like Oxford.</p></div>
