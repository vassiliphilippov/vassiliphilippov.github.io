                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The given concept 'in the south' refers to a general adverbial sense ('in a southern direction'), but its synset is essentially covered by the standard adverb 'south' (as in 'we moved south'). 'In the south' as a phrase typically refers to a location/region, and not to directional movement, which is already expressed by 'south' as an adverb. Therefore, this concept is too generic and not appropriate for inclusion as a distinct entry.</p></div>
