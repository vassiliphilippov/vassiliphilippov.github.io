                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'head-to-head' with the sense 'inconclusive as to outcome; close or just even in a race or competition' is not the primary or standard usage of 'head-to-head.' In English dictionaries like Oxford, 'head-to-head' is included primarily as an adjective or adverb meaning 'involving direct competition between two people or teams.' The sense described here (as an adjective meaning 'neck and neck', 'nip and tuck') is more idiomatically expressed by other phrases such as 'neck and neck' or 'nip and tuck.' Therefore, this sense should be excluded as it is not a standard or commonly accepted usage of 'head-to-head.'</p></div>
