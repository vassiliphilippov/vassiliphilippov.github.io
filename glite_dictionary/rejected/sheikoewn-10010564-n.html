                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'sheik' as 'a man who is much concerned with his dress and appearance' is highly dated and largely obsolete, originating from the 1920s as a slang usage based on the film 'The Sheik.' It does not appear as a common or current meaning in major dictionaries today, and thus would not be included in a modern dictionary except as a rare, archaic slang sense. The main sense of 'sheik' relates to an Arab leader or elder, which is a different concept.</p></div>
