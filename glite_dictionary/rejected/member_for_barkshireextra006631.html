                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'member for Barkshire' is too specific and context-dependent, referring to a particular person's title as a representative from a given constituency. Such entries (e.g., 'member for [Place]') are not included as general headwords in standard dictionaries like Oxford, which instead define 'member' in the context of political representation more broadly. This is not a generally used or fixed phrase that merits its own dictionary entry.</p></div>
