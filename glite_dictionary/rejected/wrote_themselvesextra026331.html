                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'wrote themselves' in this sense is not a standard dictionary entry; it is a creative, figurative use (metaphorical language) meaning experiences were easily or naturally self-expressive. It is not an established phrasal verb or idiom, nor would it merit its own entry in Oxford or similar dictionaries. Such constructions are compositional and not fixed expressions.</p></div>
