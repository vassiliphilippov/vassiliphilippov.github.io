                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'homely as a hedge fence' is an idiomatic simile, but it is not a widely recognized or established phrase in the English language and would not appear as a separate entry in standard dictionaries like Oxford. The primary adjective 'homely' is included, but this extended simile is not set or common enough for a dictionary entry.</p></div>
