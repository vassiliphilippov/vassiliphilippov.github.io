                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense 'relishing' as 'taking a small amount into the mouth to test its quality' is archaic and rarely used as a noun in modern English. The word 'relishing' is overwhelmingly used as a verb or verbal noun meaning 'enjoying greatly.' This particular noun sense is too obscure and would not appear in a standard learner's dictionary like Oxford; therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
