                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'induction' as 'stimulation that calls up a particular class of behaviors' is a specialized, technical usage found mainly in fields like psychology or physiology, and is relatively rare. The synset meaning overlaps with more common terms such as 'elicitation' or 'evocation', and this particular meaning for 'induction' is not widely encountered in general English dictionaries such as Oxford. Therefore, this sense should not be included as a primary dictionary entry.</p></div>
