                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'feel like he was in hell' is an idiomatic expression describing a state of extreme discomfort or distress, but it is not a fixed idiom or set phrase that appears in dictionaries. Instead, it is a compositional use of the words 'feel like' and 'in hell.' Dictionary entries would include 'feel like hell' (an established idiom) or 'in hell,' but not 'feel like he was in hell.'</p></div>
