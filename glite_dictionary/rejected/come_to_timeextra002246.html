                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'come to time' meaning 'to occur at the scheduled time or to be completed on schedule' is very rare and not in current general usage. It does not appear in major modern English dictionaries and would not typically be found in an Oxford Dictionary. It is not idiomatic or widely recognized, and the meaning is either obsolete or not established.</p></div>
