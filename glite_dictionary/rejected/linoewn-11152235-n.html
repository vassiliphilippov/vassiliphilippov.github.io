                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Lin' here is 'person,' which is too general and not specific to the headword. English dictionaries usually do not include proper names of people unless they are extremely well-known and have associated cultural or lexical significance. This entry refers to Maya Lin, who is notable, but the synset itself is simply 'person,' thus it does not meet the criteria for inclusion as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
