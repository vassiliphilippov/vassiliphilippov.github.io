                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'wring his clothes' is a compositional phrase consisting of the verb 'wring' and the object 'clothes.' Dictionaries include 'wring' with definitions like 'to twist and squeeze (something) to force liquid from it,' and the use with 'clothes' is a typical object rather than a distinct phrasal or idiomatic meaning. Therefore, this phrase does not warrant a separate dictionary entry as it is not a fixed expression or idiom; it is fully predictable from the meanings of its parts.</p></div>
