                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to 'marketing' with the meaning of the act of exchanging goods for money, which is essentially 'trade' or 'buying and selling.' However, in actual modern English usage, 'marketing' is primarily used for activities aimed at promoting and selling products or services, such as advertising and market research, not the transactional exchange itself. Therefore, we do not include this overly general or outdated sense, as it would not appear as a dictionary sense in Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
