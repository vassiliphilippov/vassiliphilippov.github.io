                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept of 'Hildebrand' here refers to the person, who in history is better known as Pope Gregory VII, with the synset being 'person.' Dictionary entries for personal names are typically included only if the individual is notably referred to by that name in English, or if it is a lexicalized proper noun in general English usage. In this case, 'Hildebrand' is predominantly used as a birth name for Pope Gregory VII and not as a stand-alone common noun or lexical entry. This is outside standard dictionary scope, which focuses on common nouns, adjectives, verbs, and lexicalized proper nouns, rather than biographical entries simply as personal names.</p></div>
