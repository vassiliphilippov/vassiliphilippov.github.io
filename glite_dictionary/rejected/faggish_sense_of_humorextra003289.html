                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The headword 'faggish sense of humor' contains the offensive term 'faggish', which is derived from an insulting slur commonly considered highly offensive and inappropriate for use outside of historical or critical discussion. Additionally, the phrase is not a widely attested or lexically standard term that would appear as a headword in major English dictionaries like Oxford. Such entries are usually excluded unless there is substantial evidence of widespread use and scholarly discussion, and only then with strong warnings. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
