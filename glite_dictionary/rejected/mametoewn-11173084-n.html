                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is too general (refers to 'person'), and while 'Mamet' refers to a proper noun (David Mamet, the playwright), dictionaries like Oxford typically only include encyclopedic entries for very prominent figures, and even then, often not as headwords unless they are crucial for language use. For a standard English-English dictionary, individual people's names are generally excluded unless they have also become generic words or have unique language significance. Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
