                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'change by reversal' is too general and does not correspond to a specific headword or commonly used verb in English. Instead, it appears to be a high-level description covering words like 'reverse' or 'turn,' which would be included individually. We do not include this as a dictionary entry.</p></div>
