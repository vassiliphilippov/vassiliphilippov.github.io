                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is too general, referring to 'English writer and lexicographer (1709-1784)' under the name 'Johnson', which actually represents the person Samuel Johnson. As a dictionary headword, this would typically be listed as a proper noun (biographical entry), and such entries for individual people's surnames alone (without specific distinguishing context, like 'Samuel Johnson') are generally not included in major English dictionaries unless the surname itself has become a common word or has a specific meaning. In this context, it functions just as a surname associated with a particular person, which falls outside this dictionary's scope.</p></div>
