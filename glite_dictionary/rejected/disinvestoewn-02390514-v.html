                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The sense of 'disinvest' as 'deprive of status or authority' is archaic and extremely rare in modern English; it does not appear in major dictionaries as a distinct, accepted meaning. Modern usage of 'disinvest' refers almost exclusively to withdrawing investments or capital. The concept as described is outdated and should not be included under 'disinvest' as a separate entry in a contemporary dictionary.</p></div>
