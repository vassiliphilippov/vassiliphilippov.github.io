                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Hans C. J. Gram' is 'person,' which is too general and does not provide a specific dictionary-worthy sense beyond being the name of an individual. Such biographical entries are typically included only for extremely well-known figures or those whose names have become eponyms, and even then they are generally not included under this criteria unless the word is used as a common noun or adjective (e.g., 'gram-positive'). Therefore, this concept should not be included.</p></div>
