                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'de Valera' refers to a specific person and is not a general concept, and its synset is also a proper noun denoting a unique individual. Dictionary entries for people are not generally included unless the individual is exceptionally notable and there is significant lexical use. Although de Valera is an important historical figure, general English dictionaries like Oxford Dictionary do not usually include detailed entries for individual people unless their name has become a common noun or adjective. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
