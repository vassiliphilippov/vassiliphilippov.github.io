                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept described is not specifically related to the adverb 'fully' but rather to the adverbial phrase 'in full', which means 'completely' or 'entirely' and is typically used in set phrases (e.g., 'paid in full'). The synset is about quantities being completely satisfied or filled, but as 'fully' is not naturally or usually used this way to refer to quantities (e.g., we do not typically say 'the amount was paid fully'), this sense does not need a separate entry. Instead, the phrase 'in full' may warrant its own entry, but the adverb 'fully' in the sense of ‘completely’ or ‘entirely’ is already covered in its primary sense.</p></div>
