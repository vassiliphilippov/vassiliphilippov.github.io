                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset 'fostering' in the sense of 'helping someone grow up to be an accepted member of the community' is too general and does not uniquely define a specific, widely-used noun sense distinct from 'nurture,' which already covers this meaning. This abstract, technical sense does not commonly appear as a head noun in English dictionaries and is not directly related to the canonical headword 'fostering' as it would appear for general users. Typically, 'fostering' in dictionaries refers to the act of fostering (especially caring for a child not one's own), which is a different sense. Therefore, this sense should be excluded.</p></div>
