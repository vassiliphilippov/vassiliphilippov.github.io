                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset associated with 'Louis XIV' is essentially the broad category 'person.' While 'Louis XIV' is a historically significant individual, the definition is simply his role as a person (king of France, dates of reign, etc.), and not a specific noun sense or broader concept that merits a dictionary entry beyond a biographical one. Dictionary entries are typically for terms, not specific historical figures unless their names develop distinct extended meanings. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
