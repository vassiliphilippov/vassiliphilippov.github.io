                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept given is for the pronoun 'I', but the synset and sense description refer to the number one. Since 'I' as a numeral is not standard in English (the Roman numeral 'I' is a special use and would be covered as a separate entry for Roman numerals), and the generic sense here is for 'one', which would be entered under 'one' (word) or '1' (symbol), not under 'I' as a headword, this concept should be filtered out.</p></div>
