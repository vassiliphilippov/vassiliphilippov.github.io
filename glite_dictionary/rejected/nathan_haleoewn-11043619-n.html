                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'Nathan Hale' in this synset is used simply as a person's name with the general synset 'person.' Dictionary entries for proper nouns are generally included only when the person is notable and their legacy or actions have led to widespread use as a reference (e.g., 'Benedict Arnold' as a synonym for 'traitor'). While Nathan Hale is a historical figure, the synset is too general ('person') and does not relate to any specialized sense or usage beyond being his name. Therefore, it should not be included as a dictionary entry in this case.</p></div>
