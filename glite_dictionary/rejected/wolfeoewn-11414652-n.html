                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here refers to 'person,' which is too general, and the entry only refers to Wolfe as a particular individual. Proper nouns referring to people, unless they are of major historical, literary, or cultural importance and have additional meanings or usage beyond being a person, are not typically included in general English dictionaries like Oxford. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
