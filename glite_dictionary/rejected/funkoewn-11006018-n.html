                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This synset is too general; it refers to an individual person (Casimir Funk), and the synset is simply 'person' or 'biochemist'. Dictionary entries for notable individuals are only included when their names are used as common nouns or adjectives, or have acquired a specialized meaning beyond the proper noun, which is not the case here. This would not appear as a headword in a general-purpose English dictionary like Oxford.</p></div>
