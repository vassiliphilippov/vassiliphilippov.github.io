                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'feel like an E-tard' relies on the use of the slang and highly offensive/neurodiverse-insulting term 'E-tard,' which derives from a derogatory play on 'retard' and is associated with offensive, ableist language. Such terms are generally excluded from reputable dictionaries unless they have significant usage, and inclusion would require strong warnings due to offensiveness. Moreover, this phrase is not widely used or established in the language and is derived from a slur rather than a meaningful or standalone idiom or phrasal verb. Therefore, it should NOT be included in a standard English-English dictionary.</p></div>
