                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'pen-driver' does not appear in standard English dictionaries (e.g., Oxford, Merriam-Webster) and is not widely recognized as a standard headword in English. Its sense as 'a person who works in a writing or administrative capacity' or 'a device used for writing' is not broadly attested. This concept should not be included as it is not established in general usage and would not appear in a typical English dictionary.</p></div>
