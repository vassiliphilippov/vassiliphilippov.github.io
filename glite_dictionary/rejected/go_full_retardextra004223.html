                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This phrase contains a word ('retard') that is now widely considered offensive and ableist in English when used in this sense. While the phrase has had some cultural notoriety, dictionaries—especially learner-oriented ones—do not generally include extremely offensive terms as entries, especially when their use is strongly discouraged. It is both vulgar and offensive, and would not be appropriate to provide as a dictionary entry for learners or general users, except perhaps in specialized reference works that explicitly catalogue slurs or derogatory expressions.</p></div>
