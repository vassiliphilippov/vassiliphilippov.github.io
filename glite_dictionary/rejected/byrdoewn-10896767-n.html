                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Byrd' in this context is simply 'person' and refers to William Byrd as a proper noun, which is too general for a dictionary entry. Biographical entries of historical figures like this are not typically included in general-purpose English dictionaries such as Oxford, unless the person is so influential their name has entered common usage as a word (which does not apply here).</p></div>
