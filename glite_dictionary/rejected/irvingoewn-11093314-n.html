                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'Irving' here references John Irving, identified only as a person and not as a lexicalized entry or term. Personal names of individuals, unless they have secondary meaning as common nouns/adjectives or are highly prominent across fields (and thus treated lexically), are generally not included as dictionary headwords. This entry simply denotes a specific person, which is outside the scope for standard dictionary inclusion.</p></div>
