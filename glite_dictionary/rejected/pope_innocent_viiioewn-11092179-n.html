                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>'Pope Innocent VIII' refers to a specific historical person and its synset is the proper noun for that individual, not a broader sense or title. Dictionaries like Oxford typically do not include full entries for individual names unless they have taken on common noun meanings or are extremely culturally pervasive. Biographical names are generally excluded unless they are eponyms or otherwise relevant to general usage.</p></div>
