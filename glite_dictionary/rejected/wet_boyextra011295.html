                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'wet boy' as described refers specifically to a fictional or idiosyncratic concept (possibly coined in a particular book or series) for 'a skilled assassin.' There is no substantial evidence of its use as a general term in the English language outside that specific work. It would not appear as a headword in a standard English dictionary such as Oxford, unless it gained broader usage. Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
