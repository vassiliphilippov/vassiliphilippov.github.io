                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The provided synset 'prawn cocktail offensive' does not correspond with any widely recognized meaning or usage in English that would merit inclusion in a standard dictionary. The phrase is not known as an established idiom, compound, or term in Oxford-style dictionaries, nor does it possess an independent meaning outside its literal sense. Additionally, the synset uses the term 'offensive' in a figurative way that is not well-attested with this phrase in published sources. Therefore, it should not be included.</p></div>
