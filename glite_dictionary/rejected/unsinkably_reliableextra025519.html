                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'unsinkably reliable' is not a standard compound, idiom, or phrasal verb, nor is it a widely attested fixed phrase in English. It is a creative or emphatic use of the adverb 'unsinkably' with 'reliable,' and such combinations are generally not included as dictionary headwords unless they have become established set phrases. Therefore, this concept should not be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
