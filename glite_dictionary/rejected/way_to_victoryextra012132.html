                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'way to victory' as presented here is a general phrase rather than a set idiom, phrasal verb, or compound recognized in major dictionaries. The synset refers to its use as a compositional phrase within a sentence ('all the way to victory'), but it does not have a distinct, fixed meaning beyond the sum of its parts. Therefore, it should not be included as a separate dictionary entry.</p></div>
