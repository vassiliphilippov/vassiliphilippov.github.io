                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Although Leo Esaki is a notable historical figure, the WordNet sense is simply 'physicist honored for advances in solid state electronics (born in Japan in 1925)', which is too general. Dictionary entries for people should be included only if the sense is specific to their notable contributions or as an eponym; otherwise, they are not included as general 'person' entries, per the filtering criteria.</p></div>
