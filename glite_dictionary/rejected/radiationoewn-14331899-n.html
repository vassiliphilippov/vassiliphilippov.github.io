                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This concept refers to 'radiation' in the sense of 'radiation sickness' or 'acute radiation syndrome,' which is a specific medical condition. However, the headword 'radiation' is not commonly or correctly used in standard English to mean the syndrome itself; instead, 'radiation' refers to the process of emitting energy as waves or particles. The name for the syndrome is 'radiation sickness' or 'acute radiation syndrome.' Therefore, this sense is too specialized and not appropriate under the headword 'radiation' for a general English dictionary.</p></div>
