                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'published rumor' refers to a general phrase meaning unverified information that has been disseminated or published, but it is not an established term, set phrase, or compound with a meaning notable enough to warrant its own dictionary entry. This use is transparent and compositional; 'published' and 'rumor' are both separately listed in dictionaries, and their combined meaning does not differ from the sum of their parts.</p></div>
