                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'widow woman' refers to a woman whose husband has died, especially one who has not remarried. However, this is merely a tautological or redundant phrase, as 'widow' alone universally means a woman whose husband is dead. 'Widow woman' does not have a distinct meaning from 'widow' and is not a standard entry in modern English dictionaries; it might occur in dialects or archaic texts, but is not widely used. Including it would not be useful or necessary for learners.</p></div>
