                        <div class='definition'>the federal department that administers programs that provide services to farmers (including research and soil conservation and efforts to stabilize the farming economy); created in 1862</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept describes the United States federal department ('the federal department that administers programs...'), not the ordinary, general-noun meaning of 'agriculture' (the practice of farming). The synset is too specific and organizational, referring to 'the Department of Agriculture,' i.e., a named institution. Such specific government departments usually do not get their own sense in general-purpose English dictionaries, unless as proper nouns. 'Agriculture' as a noun meaning 'farming and related industries' would be included, but not this governmental sense.</p></div>
