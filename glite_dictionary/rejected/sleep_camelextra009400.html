                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The term 'sleep camel' is not a widely recognized English word, compound, idiom, or phrasal verb, nor is it attested in major dictionaries. It appears to be a nonce formation or a playful, context-specific expression rather than an established concept with stable meaning. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for inclusion in a dictionary such as the Oxford Dictionary.</p></div>
