                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset here is simply 'person' or refers to the individual Benny Goodman by surname, which is too general for inclusion as a dictionary entry. Such biographical names are typically not included as headwords unless their status or historical significance extends to broader meanings (e.g., 'Einstein' meaning 'genius'). This entry refers directly to a specific person's name and does not represent a term with a more general meaning.</p></div>
