                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers to a compositional phrase ('the smell of') rather than a fixed expression, idiom, or established headword. This construction is too general for a dictionary entry, as 'the smell of' simply combines the noun 'smell' with a prepositional phrase, and its meaning is transparently derived from the meanings of its parts. Such phrases are not included in major English dictionaries unless they have a fixed, idiomatic usage (which is not the case here).</p></div>
