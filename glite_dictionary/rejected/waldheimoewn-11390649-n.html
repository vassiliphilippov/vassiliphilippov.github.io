                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The primary synset is just 'person', which is too general. 'Waldheim' as a proper noun referring to an individual (Kurt Waldheim) should not be included unless the name is highly established as an entry in dictionaries, which is rare for most surnames and generally only applies to especially iconic figures. Standard dictionaries do not typically include entries for most people unless their name has acquired broader connotative meaning beyond referencing the person themselves.</p></div>
