                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The phrase 'suck tits' in this sense appears to be a very obscure, vulgar, and likely marginal usage. It does not have established, widespread usage or clear lexicalization as a set idiom in English and would not be included in reputable dictionaries like Oxford. The phrase is also extremely crude, and is not widely recognizable as having the figurative meaning claimed. Therefore, it should be excluded.</p></div>
