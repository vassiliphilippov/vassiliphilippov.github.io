                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>Christiania is the former name of what is now known as Oslo, the capital of Norway. In modern English usage, Christiania is only used in historical contexts to refer to the city before it was renamed Oslo in 1925. Dictionaries like Oxford generally list the current form (Oslo) as the headword, possibly mentioning Christiania as a historical note, but do not give Christiania a standalone entry as the contemporary name of the city. Therefore, it should not be included as a full dictionary entry under this synset.</p></div>
