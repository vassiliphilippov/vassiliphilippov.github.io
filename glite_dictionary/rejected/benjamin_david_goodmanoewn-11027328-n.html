                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset of this concept is 'person', which is overly general and not specific to the headword. Individual people are typically only included in general dictionaries if they are proper nouns with unique significance and well-known beyond encyclopedic contexts. This type of entry is more appropriate for an encyclopedia than an English-English dictionary focused on lexical meaning. Therefore, the concept is excluded.</p></div>
