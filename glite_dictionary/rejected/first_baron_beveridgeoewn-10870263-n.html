                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'First Baron Beveridge' is a specific title referring to an individual person (William Beveridge), and its synset is simply 'person' with this biographical note. Dictionary entries generally do not include individual people unless they have become eponymous or their names have acquired additional meanings; otherwise, this material belongs more in an encyclopedia than in an English-English dictionary. Therefore, this concept is excluded.</p></div>
