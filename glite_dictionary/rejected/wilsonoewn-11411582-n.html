                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to 'Wilson' with the synset 'person' and denotes a specific individual (James Wilson). Dictionary entries for surnames referring to people are only included when they refer to well-established proper nouns with specialized meaning or extremely prominent figures with unique common-usage meaning. In this context, 'Wilson' is too general (a surname), and the sense is simply a specific person. Standard English dictionaries would include a biographical entry only for people of exceptional global historical significance, and under their full names. Therefore, this concept should be filtered out.</p></div>
