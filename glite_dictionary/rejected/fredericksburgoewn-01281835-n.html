                        <div class='definition'>an important battle in the American Civil War (1862); the Union Army under A. E. Burnside was defeated by the Confederate Army under Robert E. Lee</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset refers specifically to an important battle ('an important battle in the American Civil War') but the headword 'Fredericksburg' is also a place name and a proper noun. Dictionaries like Oxford typically would not include individual historical events under a proper noun entry unless they are universally recognized as such (e.g., 'Waterloo'). However, the WordNet sense seems to treat it as naming a specific event rather than the place itself. Given that the synset is better covered under encyclopedic or historical entries rather than as a general dictionary definition, and because the headword is a proper noun referring to a location, not specifically an event for dictionary purposes, it should be excluded.</p></div>
