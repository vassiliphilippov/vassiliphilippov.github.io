                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>This sense of 'dish' as 'an activity that you like or at which you are superior' is obsolete, nonstandard, and not used in contemporary English. It does not appear as a recognized or current sense in major English dictionaries such as Oxford, and is only attested in rare, archaic, or figurative expressions. Therefore, it should not be included in the dictionary.</p></div>
