                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept 'shoot-down' in this sense refers to 'murder by shooting someone down in cold blood,' but this noun use is rare, nonstandard, and does not have substantiated evidence of use as a lexicalized noun in contemporary or historical English. It is not attested as a dictionary-worthy noun in Oxford or major dictionaries. The verb phrase 'shoot down' (to shoot someone or something down) is standard and appears as a phrasal verb, but not this noun sense. Therefore, it should not be included as a stand-alone noun entry in the dictionary.</p></div>
