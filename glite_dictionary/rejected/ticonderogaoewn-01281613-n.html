                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The concept refers to 'Ticonderoga' as a historical battle, but its synset is not specific to the headword; it is the name of the fort and the battle, but this sense is very specific and not likely to be included as a dictionary entry outside an encyclopedia. Oxford Dictionary would have 'Ticonderoga' as a proper noun (the place or fort), but not as the specific 1775 battle, which is an encyclopedic entry. Therefore, it does not meet inclusion criteria for the dictionary as a standard headword.</p></div>
