                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset for 'Maxwell' here is 'person', which is too general and simply refers to the fact that James Clerk Maxwell was a person. Dictionary entries for proper nouns like renowned scientists are usually only included if they refer specifically to the person (e.g., 'James Clerk Maxwell'), rather than the general term 'person', and only if they are not covered solely as a biographical entry rather than a common noun. Therefore, this concept should be excluded.</p></div>
