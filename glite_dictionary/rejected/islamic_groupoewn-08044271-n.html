                        <div class='definition'>a clandestine group of southeast Asian terrorists organized in 1993 and trained by al-Qaeda; supports militant Muslims in Indonesia and the Philippines and has cells in Singapore and Malaysia and Indonesia</div>
                        
                        <div class='etymology'><h3>Reason</h3><p class='etymology-body'>The synset is not specific to the uniquely named organization 'Islamic Group,' and describes a general type of organization rather than a proper noun with distinctive properties. Additionally, 'Islamic Group' as described is not a standard, widely recognized dictionary lemma in the way required by major dictionaries. Dictionaries typically include names of terrorist organizations only if they are widely recognized proper nouns ('al-Qaeda', 'Jemaah Islamiyah'). This entry is overly general and would not appear in Oxford or similar dictionaries as a headword.</p></div>
