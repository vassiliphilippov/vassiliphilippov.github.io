            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>By far the largest group of artistic languages are fictional languages (sometimes also referred to as ‘professional artlangs’), intended to be the languages of a fictional world, and often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated.</blockquote></div>
