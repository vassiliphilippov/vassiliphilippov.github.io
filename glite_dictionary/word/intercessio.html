            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>During the Roman Republic, the tribunes exercised their <b>intercessio</b> to block laws they deemed unfair.</blockquote><blockquote>An understanding of <b>intercessio</b> is crucial to studying the checks and balances of Roman governance.</blockquote><blockquote>The use of <b>intercessio</b> was one way that the plebeians could counter the power of patrician officials.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>The intercessio was thus a supervision, exercised by closely-related magistrates, who were theoretically irresponsible during their year of office over one another's functions, for the prevention of illegal or inequitable actions; and on the part of the tribune a general supervision over all other magistracies in the interests, originally of the plebs, later of the whole community.</blockquote></div>
