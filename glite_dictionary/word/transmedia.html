            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an example of <b>transmedia</b> storytelling, spanning films, comics, and television shows.</blockquote><blockquote>The project's <b>transmedia</b> approach allowed fans to experience the story through games, books, and web series.</blockquote><blockquote>Effective <b>transmedia</b> strategies can engage audiences by weaving a narrative across social media, podcasts, and movies.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>Transmedia systems, like that exemplified by Game of Thrones, are becoming increasingly prevalent (e.g., Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Walking Dead, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, etc); these systems demonstrate, in microcosm, the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society.</blockquote><blockquote>The study of how people, as fans, access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry, but to the wider context of cultural studies, by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user.</blockquote><blockquote>For us, as digital humanists, defining the “transmedia fan” is of particular relevance as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies.</blockquote></div>
