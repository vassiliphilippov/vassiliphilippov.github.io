            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The beater swung his bat and sent the <b>bludger</b> flying toward the opposing team's seeker.</blockquote><blockquote>Three <b>bludgers</b> are used in Muggle Quidditch, and they are typically dodgeballs.</blockquote><blockquote>During practice, Alice narrowly avoided being hit by a speeding <b>bludger</b>.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat.</blockquote><blockquote>This guide suggests ways to play Harry Potter's game of Quidditch in real life (Muggle Quidditch), by optionally riding on brooms, using three deflated dodge balls as bludgers for beaters to bat at players, a volleyball as a quaffle for chasers to throw into goal hoops, and a coin, ball or a running person as the snitch, which possibly blindfolded seekers must find.</blockquote><blockquote>Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field.</blockquote></div>
