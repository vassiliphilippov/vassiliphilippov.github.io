            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The researchers developed an <b>agent-based model</b> to simulate disease spread within the city.</blockquote><blockquote>In economics, an <b>agent-based model</b> can analyze market dynamics among independent buyers and sellers.</blockquote><blockquote>An <b>agent-based model</b> revealed how traffic congestion emerges from the behavior of individual drivers.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>Agent-based models have been used since the mid-1990s to solve a variety of business and technology problems. Examples of applications include the modeling of organizational behaviour and cognition, team working, supply chain optimization and logistics, modeling of consumer behavior, including word of mouth, social network effects, distributed computing, workforce management, and portfolio management.</blockquote></div>
