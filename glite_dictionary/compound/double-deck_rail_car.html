            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The commuter train used a <b>double-deck rail car</b> to accommodate more passengers during rush hour.</blockquote><blockquote>Engineers designed a new <b>double-deck rail car</b> for long-distance travel to improve comfort and seating capacity.</blockquote><blockquote>On busy routes, <b>double-deck rail cars</b> help reduce crowding while offering scenic views from the upper level.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>When double-deck carriages (bilevel cars) were introduced on North American railways (railroads) they identified a problem in that it would be physically difficult - if not impossible - for the conductor to verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car, especially in suburban passenger service, owing to the short distance between stops.</blockquote></div>
