            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Commuters preferred the new <b>bilevel rail car</b> because it provided more seats during rush hour.</blockquote><blockquote>The city upgraded its fleet with <b>bilevel rail cars</b> to accommodate the growing number of travelers.</blockquote><blockquote>A <b>bilevel rail car</b> can carry almost twice as many passengers as a standard single-level car.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>When double-deck carriages (bilevel cars) were introduced on North American railways (railroads) they identified a problem in that it would be physically difficult - if not impossible - for the conductor to verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car, especially in suburban passenger service, owing to the short distance between stops.</blockquote></div>
