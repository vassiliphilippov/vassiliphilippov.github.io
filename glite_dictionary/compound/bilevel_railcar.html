            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The new train features a <b>bilevel railcar</b> design, allowing more passengers to be seated comfortably during rush hour.</blockquote><blockquote>Many commuter lines have switched to <b>bilevel railcar</b>s to handle increased ridership without adding extra trains.</blockquote><blockquote>From the platform, you could see the distinctive tall profile of the <b>bilevel railcar</b> as it pulled into the station.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>When double-deck carriages (bilevel cars) were introduced on North American railways (railroads) they identified a problem in that it would be physically difficult - if not impossible - for the conductor to verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car, especially in suburban passenger service, owing to the short distance between stops.</blockquote></div>
