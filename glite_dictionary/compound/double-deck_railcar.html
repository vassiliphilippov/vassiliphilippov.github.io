            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The new <b>double-deck railcar</b> increased the train's passenger capacity during rush hour.</blockquote><blockquote>Many commuter trains in Europe feature at least one <b>double-deck railcar</b> on busy routes.</blockquote><blockquote>Passengers enjoyed the view from the upper level of the <b>double-deck railcar</b> as they traveled through the countryside.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>When double-deck carriages (bilevel cars) were introduced on North American railways (railroads) they identified a problem in that it would be physically difficult - if not impossible - for the conductor to verify, collect payment and sell tickets to such a large concentration of passengers in one car, especially in suburban passenger service, owing to the short distance between stops.</blockquote></div>
