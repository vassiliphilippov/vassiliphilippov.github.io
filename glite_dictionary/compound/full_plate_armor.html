            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The knight wore <b>full plate armor</b> as he rode into battle, shining in the sunlight.</blockquote><blockquote>During the tournament, only those who could afford <b>full plate armor</b> competed in the joust.</blockquote><blockquote>Because of its weight, <b>full plate armor</b> required great strength and endurance to wear for long periods.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>Full plate armour was expensive to produce and remained therefore restricted to the upper strata of society; lavishly decorated suits of armour remained the fashion with 18th-century nobles and generals long after they had ceased to be militarily useful on the battlefield due to the advent of inexpensive muskets.</blockquote></div>
