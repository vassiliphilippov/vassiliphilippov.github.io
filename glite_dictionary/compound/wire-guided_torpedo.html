            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>Typically, wire-guided torpedoes initially run at low speed (in order to maximize their range and to minimize their self-generated noise) while they close the range (the approach speed) and speed up during the attack phase (the attack speed).</blockquote></div>
