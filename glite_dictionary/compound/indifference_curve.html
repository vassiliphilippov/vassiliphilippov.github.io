            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The concept of the <b>indifference curve</b> is fundamental in modern consumer choice theory.</blockquote><blockquote>When designing new products, economists may analyze how the <b>indifference curve</b> shifts with changes in income.</blockquote><blockquote>Each point on an <b>indifference curve</b> represents a combination of goods that the consumer values equally.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>Since every (X , Y) combination will have an indifference curve passing through it, we can add a third axis stretching upward from the bottom left corner of the figure measuring the degree to which the individual's preferences are satisfied, and visualize the infinitely many indifference curves as representing a smooth surface that rises as the consumption of commodities X and Y increase.</blockquote></div>
