            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The electrician measured the <b>real power</b> delivered to the heater using a wattmeter.</blockquote><blockquote>Because of the poor power factor, the <b>real power</b> consumed was much less than the apparent power.</blockquote><blockquote>Upgrading the equipment improved the <b>real power</b> efficiency of the entire system.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>For two systems transmitting the same amount of active power, the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load.</blockquote></div>
