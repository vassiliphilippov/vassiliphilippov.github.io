            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>The mathematical relation between these two experiments was recognized in 1909 by the French mathematician Émile Borel, who used the then new ideas of measure theory to give a precise mathematical model and to formulate what is now called the strong law of large numbers for fair coin tossing.</blockquote></div>
