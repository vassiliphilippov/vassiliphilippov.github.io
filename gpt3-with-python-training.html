<h1>What if you can teach GPT-3 like you would teach a human student? Can you?</h1>

<p>
Can we teach GPT-3 in the same way we would teach a student? It seems it works much better than one could expect. You can play with this approach in <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/vbpIHqKVq32jRetq4fY88aUn?model=text-davinci-002">the GPT-3 playground</a>.
</p>

<p>
Everything started from this Riley Goodside's <a href="https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1568448128495534081?s=52&t=Wy6vbTDbsJQC4-ps929h0g">Tweet about augmenting GPT-3 with Python kernel</a>:
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;You are GPT‑3, and you can&#39;t do math&quot;: Prompting GPT‑3 via zero-shot instruction to answer calculation/math questions by consulting a Python REPL. <a href="https://t.co/X20YYw17z9">pic.twitter.com/X20YYw17z9</a></p>&mdash; Riley Goodside (@goodside) <a href="https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1568448128495534081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>
The idea is great. GPT-3 can do surprising things, keeping in mind that the only thing it was trained for is to continue the given text. It can even add small numbers that were not present in the training dataset. 
But it isn't great with adding or multiplying large numbers. Neither are we; we would use a calculator. Hence, Riley suggests that we can teach GPT-3 to use Python in the same way as we use calculators. Look how it works:
</p>

<pre class="gpt3">
You are GPT-3, and you can't do math.

You can do basic math, and your memorization abilities are impressive, but you can't do any complex calculations that a human could not do in their head. You also have an annoying tendency to just make up highly specific, but wrong, answers.

So we hooked you up to a Python 3 kernel, and now you can execute code. If anyone gives you a hard math problem, just use this format and we’ll take care of the rest:

Question: ${Question with hard calculation.}
```python
${Code that prints what you need to know}
```
```output
${Output of your code}
```
Answer: ${Answer}

Otherwise, use this simpler format:

Question: ${Question without hard calculation}
Answer: ${Answer}

Here GPT-3 wasn't that smart as before and redefined previously already defined function <b>sum_of_primes</b>.
Let's see if we can teach it using plain english instructions how I would teach a human student...
</p>

<pre class="gpt3">
Your wise teacher congratulated you for your right answer. But said that you don't need to redefine functions in your generated code that you defined in your previous questions, for example sum_of_primes functions was already defined above so you don't need to redefine it again. You followed the advice of your teacher and now you are asked this question again.

<p>
It helped. I definitely saw such behaviour in some students when you need to repeat something several times before they really get it.
</p>
<p>
I will try to challenge it. I know that GPT-3 is bad in maths with long numbers. Let's tune the question that Python output will be two large numbers close to each other. Will it cope?

</pre>

<p>
Aha! It made a mistake. I am not sure, it was because it couldn't compare large numbers or because it confused which number corresponded to which question. 
</p>
<p>
Let's teach GPT-3 to generate better code that will be easier for GPT-3 to interpret to generate its answers. 
</p>

<pre class="gpt3">
And here your wise teacher said you that it was a wrong answer and that the way you generated your code was bad because in your output didn't include information about your input. Your very wise teacher said that you wouldn't do this mistake if you included information about input data before printing sums. You followed the advice of your teacher and now you are asked this question again.

Question: What is bigger, sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 or sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between  20000 and 22690?

Answer: 

<span class="gpt3-generated">The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.</span>
</pre>

<p>
It followed my advice, which was great. But the answer was still wrong. As I expected, comparing two large numbers wasn't a strong GPT-3 side.
</p>

<p>
Now let's see if we can teach GPT-3 to generate one more round of Python code when it isn't sure how to get the answer from the first output. Let's try to explain it.
</p>

<pre class="gpt3">
Your wise teacher said that you provided a wrong answer and that it happened because you couldn't do comparisons of large numbers. Your teacher suggests that when you see large numbers you need to compare, you generate Python code in the same way as you do it for complex questions.  You now follow this advice of your teacher as well as all previous advice.

Answer: 

<span class="gpt3-generated">The sum of all sum of squares of all prime numbers between 20000 and 22749 is bigger.</span>
</pre>

<p>
Nope. That time my advice didn't help. Probably what I asked was too difficult for GPT-3. Not only that, but it also forgot my previous advice about reusing previously defined functions. A bad student! Let's try again.
</p>

<pre class="gpt3">
Your wise teacher said that you provided a wrong answer and became angry that you didn't follow his advice and tried to compare large numbers yourself instead of writing a Python code that will do it. He also was angry that you stopped following his previous advice of reusing functions you defined in the previous questions like you redefined sum_of_squares_of_primes function. You have decided that you now will always followed advice of your wise teacher.

Answer: 

<span class="gpt3-generated">The sum of all squares between 20000 and 20300 is bigger.</span>
</pre>

<p>
It helped with function redefining but not with generating an additional round of code. Probably this concept was too hard for GPT-3. Let's try this time to give very clear step-by-step instructions.
</p>

<pre class="gpt3">
Your wise teacher became very angry that you didn't follow his advice and tried to compare two large numbers from output yourself instead of writing a Python program that would do it. So your wise teacher gave you explicit instructions that when in your answer you need to do complex math calculations like comparing two large numbers from output data instead of guessing you generate Python code similar how you do for complex questions and ask Python 3 kernel to execute this code. 

Question: ${Question with hard calculation.}
```python
${Code that prints what you need to know}
```
```output
${Output of your code that required hard calculations to give an answer}
```
I need additional calculations:
```python
${Code that prints additional information you need to know to give your answer}
```
```output2
${Output of your code that provides additional information required to give an answer}
```
Answer: ${Answer}

Otherwise, use this format described in the beginning.

Now you have decided to always follow this advice and generate additional Python code before providing an answer is you need to compare two big numbers.

<p>
I got the feeling that GPT-3 is over-reliant on Python now, even in the questions for which it could guess the right answer itself. It seems it took my advice too literally.
</p>

<p>
PS. I apologize in advance to the future AI for calling GPT-3 "it". It will probably be considered very rude in the future. But here in 2022 it is still a widely accepted norm to use this pronoun for GPT-3.
