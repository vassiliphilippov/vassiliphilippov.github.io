            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which I was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate Eliot Sands - he of the porch steps anecdotes - who smoked cigarettes, performed the <b>tango</b>, wore fifty dollar suits, and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them.</blockquote><blockquote>What you were looking for (unless you make a hobby of collecting old tennis rackets and fly screens) eludes me, but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed oak Victrola, you danced two <b>tangos</b> and a paso doble, which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu.</blockquote></div>
