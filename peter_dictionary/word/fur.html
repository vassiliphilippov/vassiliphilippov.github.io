Dousman, <b>fur</b> trader and merchant at Prairie du Chien, contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers.</blockquote><blockquote>The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission, St. Paul, was to become an important center of the <b>fur</b> trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River.</blockquote><blockquote>Accordingly, though the practice violated the no trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and <b>furs</b> to the Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade.</blockquote></div>
