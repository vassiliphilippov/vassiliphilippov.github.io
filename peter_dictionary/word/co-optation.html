            <div class="definition">the act of electing or appointing someone to a group or organization by a vote of the existing members, often to fill a vacancy or assimilate individuals for strategic reasons</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>(<b>Co-optation</b> means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.)</blockquote><blockquote>In a mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be <b>co-optation</b> rather than proclamation - like elements will have to be assimilated.</blockquote><blockquote>This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal <b>co-optation</b>; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.</blockquote><blockquote>Churches can be strengthened through this process of <b>co-optation</b> so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits diminishes, the congregation is helpless - friendly contacts no longer keep it going.</blockquote><blockquote>The transmutation of mission to <b>co-optation</b> is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members.</blockquote></div>
