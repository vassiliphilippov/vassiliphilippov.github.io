            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Stained or unstained sections were examined under dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence <b>microscope</b> equipped with a mercury vapor lamp (Osram HBO 200).</blockquote><blockquote>Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated * * f and * * f, although clearly distinguishable under the <b>microscope</b> from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells, was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography.</blockquote><blockquote>The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a <b>microscope</b> lying on its side on the window sill, vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air, masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house, visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor.</blockquote><blockquote>A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a <b>microscope</b> with a color - TV system to view the results.</blockquote><blockquote>These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the <b>microscope</b>.</blockquote></div>
