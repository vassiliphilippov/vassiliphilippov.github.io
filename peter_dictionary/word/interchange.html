            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The new <b>interchange</b> among the four Los Angeles freeways, including the grade-constructed accesses, occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land, one-eighth of a square mile, an area about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York.</blockquote><blockquote>As it affects the city's fiscal situation, such an <b>interchange</b> is ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services.</blockquote><blockquote>Downtown Los Angeles is already two-thirds freeway, <b>interchange</b>, street, parking lot and garage - one of those preposterous "if "statistics has already come to pass.</blockquote><blockquote>The freeway with narrowly spaced <b>interchanges</b> concentrates and mitigates the access problem, but it also acts inevitably as an artificial, isolating boundary.</blockquote><blockquote>Less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful - especially when the roadways and <b>interchanges</b> are raised, allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the ramp.</blockquote></div>
