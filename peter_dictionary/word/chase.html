            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The "<b>chase</b> "as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery, and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>chase</b> in itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting - both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both.</blockquote><blockquote>The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane <b>chase</b> are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; these films and these sequences are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.</blockquote><blockquote>The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which rejects stories about hoop snakes, about snakes that break themselves into many pieces and join up again, or even of ghosts that <b>chase</b> people out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove, to the scientific mind, the existence of hoop snakes, joint snakes, or ghosts.</blockquote><blockquote>If we cluster together, the redcoats can make an advantage out of it, but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except <b>chase</b> us, and we can outrun them ".</blockquote></div>
