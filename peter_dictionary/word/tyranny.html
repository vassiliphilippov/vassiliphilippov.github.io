            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist <b>tyranny</b> into cringing submission.</blockquote><blockquote>To guard against the <b>tyranny</b> of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his theory of "concurrent majority ", which, he said, "by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial or local legislation ".</blockquote><blockquote>There results a study of literature freed from the <b>tyranny</b> of the contemporary.</blockquote></div>
