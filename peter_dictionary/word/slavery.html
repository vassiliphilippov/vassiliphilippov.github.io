            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>All Southerners agree that <b>slavery</b> had to go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did.</blockquote><blockquote>The Providence Daily Journal answered the Daily Post by stating that the raid of John Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that "He was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party, who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with <b>slavery</b> in the states ".</blockquote><blockquote>Despite the opposition of the city newspapers, the Pratt Hall meeting "brought together a very respectable audience, composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of <b>slavery</b>, of many of our colored citizens, and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering ".</blockquote><blockquote>He spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of <b>slavery</b> by peaceable means and he compared John Brown of Harper's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's colonial period.</blockquote><blockquote>Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of Brown's attempt at servile insurrection, his admiration of Brown's character, and his opposition to <b>slavery</b>.</blockquote></div>
