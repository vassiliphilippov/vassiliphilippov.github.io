            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Three thermocouples were placed at different locations in the <b>aluminum</b> disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its temperature.</blockquote><blockquote>The thermocouples in the <b>aluminum</b> disk shown in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of **f.</blockquote><blockquote>The silver chloride was fused under vacuum in the presence of <b>aluminum</b> chips with the resultant product of * * f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet if he were not there, they would have missed him, as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June; or the smell of thick tomato paste - the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour - rising up from <b>aluminum</b> trays wrapped in fly dotted cheesecloth.</blockquote><blockquote>This work gave a heat of formation of <b>aluminum</b> fluoride which closely substantiates a value which had been determined by a less direct method, and raises this property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago.</blockquote></div>
