            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem of suffering "); the miraculous way in which music, revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art, a rather <b>desperate</b> art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.</blockquote><blockquote>As Hudson resumed his <b>desperate</b> criss-crossing of the little bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him.</blockquote><blockquote>This conformity represents a <b>desperate</b> attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment.</blockquote><blockquote>Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a <b>desperate</b>, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis.</blockquote><blockquote>After the collapse of that <b>desperate</b> and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous.</blockquote></div>
