            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>My great grandmother, I have been told, made her garden her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like <b>oleanders</b> in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed, and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house.</blockquote></div>

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p class="etymology-body">From Latin 'oleander', alteration of 'variant of 'olea' (olive) and 'andros' (man), possibly because the leaves resemble those of the olive tree.</p>
