            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas, secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of <b>germanium</b> resistors, and helium 4 vapor-pressure measurements (see p. 144).</blockquote><blockquote>Carbon resistors and impurity doped <b>germanium</b> resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region.</blockquote><blockquote>Several <b>germanium</b> resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.</blockquote></div>
