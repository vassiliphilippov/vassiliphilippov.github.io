            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Not only was Haumd's <b>intonation</b> and phrasing without flaw, but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride.</blockquote><blockquote>All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum, while exclamations having complimentary <b>intonations</b> are more than customarily encouraged.</blockquote><blockquote>Tone and <b>intonation</b> often become seriously intermeshed.</blockquote><blockquote>Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap in this way; for example, duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the <b>intonation</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>But no other two phonologic systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and <b>intonation</b> in some languages.</blockquote></div>
