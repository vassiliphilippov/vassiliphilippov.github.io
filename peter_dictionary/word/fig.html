            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The deep concave gradient employed (<b>fig.</b> 2) was obtained with a nine chambered gradient elution device ("Varigrad ", reference (8)) and has been described elsewhere.</blockquote><blockquote>the other, a shallow concave gradient (<b>Fig.</b> 1), was produced with a so-called "cone sphere "apparatus, the "cone "being a 2 - liter Erlenmeyer flask and the "sphere, "a 2 - liter round-bottom flask.</blockquote><blockquote>With either of the gradients described, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated agglutinins of the ABO series into at least three regions (<b>Figs.</b> 1 and 2):</blockquote><blockquote>These have been labeled Regions 1, 2, and 4, respectively, in <b>Fig.</b> 1.</blockquote><blockquote>When the early part of the gradient was flattened, either by using the gradient shown in <b>Fig.</b> 2 or by allowing the "cone sphere "gradient to become established more slowly, Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas (donors P. J. and R. S., Fig. 1 and E. M., Fig. 2).</blockquote></div>
