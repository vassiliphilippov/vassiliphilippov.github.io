            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It is roughly shaped like a large <b>pear</b>, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin covers a meaty, melon like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear, but oily.</blockquote><blockquote>The flavor is neither sweet, like a <b>pear</b>, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland, nut like.</blockquote><blockquote>I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November; ripe <b>pears</b> lying in long grass, to be turned over by a dusty slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked in the ragged, brown edged holes; hot colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on our way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.</blockquote><blockquote>What a nice <b>pear</b>!</blockquote></div>
