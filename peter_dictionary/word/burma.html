            <div class="definition">A former name for Myanmar, a country in Southeast Asia bordered by India, China, and Thailand. The name 'Burma' was officially changed to 'Myanmar' in 1989, though 'Burma' is still used in some contexts.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The appointment of U Thant of <b>Burma</b> as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General - at this writing, the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends.</blockquote><blockquote>In all the bitter in-fighting, the squabbles over election procedures, the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme, the gentleman from <b>Burma</b> showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat.</blockquote><blockquote>When we look at countries like Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and <b>Burma</b>, where substantial progress has been made in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital, and where institutions of centralized government exist, we find a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence different priorities for policy.</blockquote></div>
