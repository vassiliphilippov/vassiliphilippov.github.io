            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The quantity of water flow may be critical; a stream or <b>pond</b> which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer.</blockquote><blockquote>In the midwest, oxidation <b>ponds</b> are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas.</blockquote><blockquote>The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation <b>pond</b> but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume.</blockquote><blockquote>Research at Fayette, Missouri on oxidation <b>ponds</b> has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre.</blockquote><blockquote>Since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation <b>ponds</b> do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations, the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds.</blockquote></div>
