            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>A band of <b>robbers</b> enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes.</blockquote><blockquote>A posse is formed and pursues the <b>robbers</b>, who, having made their escape, are whooping it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>robbers</b> run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot dead by the posse.</blockquote><blockquote>As the <b>robbers</b> leave the looted train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor.</blockquote><blockquote>The cowboy films, the cops and <b>robbers</b> films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; these films and these sequences are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.</blockquote></div>
