F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>As controls, other sections were similarly treated with * * f or conjugated <b>antiserum</b> to the New York strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus (Wolcyrz and Black, 1956).</blockquote><blockquote>The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with * * f and * * f but not with NS and * * f or with <b>antiserum</b> to potato yellow-dwarf virus and * * f, and the absence of such staining in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover, indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained.</blockquote><blockquote>Sections of tumors incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum or conjugated <b>antiserum</b> to potato yellow-dwarf virus.</blockquote></div>
