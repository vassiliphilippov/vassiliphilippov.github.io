            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In a symposium and general exploration of the field of Person Perception and Interpersonal Behavior the discussion does not touch upon this aspect of the subject, with one possible exception; Solomon Asch shows the transcultural stability of <b>metaphors</b> based on sensation (hot, sweet, bitter, etc.) dealing with personal qualities of human beings and events.</blockquote><blockquote>But to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to <b>metaphor</b> and language will also be more sensitive to personal differences is too great an inferential leap.</blockquote><blockquote>Or, equally often, a concretistic seeming, particularistic seeming statement may consist, with its mundane exterior, in a form of poetry - may be full of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression: a <b>metaphor</b>, a simile, an allegory, or some other symbolic mode of speaking.</blockquote></div>
