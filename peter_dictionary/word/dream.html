V. Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania, <b>dreamed</b> that a Babylonian priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B.C..) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification.</blockquote><blockquote>He was only <b>dreaming</b>.</blockquote></div>
