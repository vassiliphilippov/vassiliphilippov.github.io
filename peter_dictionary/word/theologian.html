            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early <b>theologians</b>, especially the Greek speaking ones.</blockquote><blockquote>If death receives more than its share of attention from the <b>theologian</b> and if sin receives less than its share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal, i.e., created, existence.</blockquote><blockquote>It was not even in writing Latin epigrams, sometimes bawdy ones, or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics, or in attacking the conservative <b>theologians</b> who opposed Erasmus's philological study of the New Testament.</blockquote><blockquote>This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and <b>theologians</b> in the Middle Ages; and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time, although it was not accepted by all the <b>theologian</b> philosophers of the Middle Ages.</blockquote></div>
