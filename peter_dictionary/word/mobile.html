            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In a <b>mobile</b> society, congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation - like elements will have to be assimilated.</blockquote><blockquote>The expense of this type of organization in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a <b>mobile</b> society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development.</blockquote></div>
