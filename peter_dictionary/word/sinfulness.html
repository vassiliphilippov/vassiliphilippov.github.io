            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>His rage assumes a religious form; that is, on the basis of his own <b>sinfulness</b> and abject wretchedness, Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life - not only the cyclist now, but the audience, the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed ".</blockquote><blockquote>His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically, connected with his <b>sinfulness</b>; the two may in fact be identical.</blockquote><blockquote>In contrast to this Stoic patristic view, Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human <b>sinfulness</b> in a sieve.</blockquote></div>
