Bluthenzweig; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the <b>painter</b>'s mistress.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Painters</b> left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep.</blockquote><blockquote>Roy Mason is essentially a landscape <b>painter</b> whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century, especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman.</blockquote></div>
