            <div class="definition">The state of being awake, conscious, and aware of one's surroundings, especially as opposed to being asleep.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Before we comment further on these pathological conditions, we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limits distinguish sleep from <b>wakefulness</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, a low intensity of hypothalamic cortical discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during <b>wakefulness</b>, resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition.</blockquote><blockquote>Since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects of <b>wakefulness</b> while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces sleep, it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus.</blockquote><blockquote>It was assumed that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures follows the pattern known from the sleep <b>wakefulness</b> cycle.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>consciousness during wakefulness in a sane person is pretty well ordered and familiar</blockquote></div>
