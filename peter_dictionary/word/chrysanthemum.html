            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white <b>chrysanthemums</b> beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned over by a dusty slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked in the ragged, brown edged holes; hot colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on our way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.</blockquote></div>
