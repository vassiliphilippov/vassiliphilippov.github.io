            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Fahey and Morrison used a single, continuous gradient at constant pH for the fractionation of anti - A and anti - B <b>agglutinins</b> from preisolated | g-globulin samples.</blockquote><blockquote>Successive 1 - ml fractions were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe, starting at the top of the tube, and tested for <b>agglutinin</b> activity.</blockquote><blockquote>The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense <b>agglutinin</b> activity, regardless of the blood group of the donor.</blockquote><blockquote>With either of the gradients described, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separated <b>agglutinins</b> of the ABO series into at least three regions (Figs. 1 and 2):</blockquote><blockquote>In 2 of 15 experiments on whole serum a region of <b>agglutinin</b> activity with intermediate anionic binding capacity was detected (Region 3, Fig. 1).</blockquote></div>
