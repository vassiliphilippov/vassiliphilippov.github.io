E. McNaughton of Barnumville and E. G.

G. L. Manthey (1769 - 1842), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to his academic chair, was also <b>proprietor</b> of the "Lion Pharmacy "in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him.</blockquote><blockquote>Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O' Connor, the <b>proprieter</b> of a Loop gambling house.</blockquote></div>
