John D. Henderson will <b>preach</b> on "A Successful Marriage "at 9: 40 and 11 a. m. Sunday.</blockquote><blockquote>All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect, he was practicing what he <b>preached</b> in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared: "We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk, and listen, with reason ".</blockquote></div>
