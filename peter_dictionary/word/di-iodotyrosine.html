            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In addition, the iodoamino acid formed in largest quantity in the intact thyroid is <b>di-iodotyrosine</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The mono - and <b>di-iodotyrosine</b> must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine.</blockquote><blockquote>The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain <b>di-iodotyrosine</b> analogues (Pitt-Rivers and James, 1958).</blockquote><blockquote>This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono - and <b>di-iodotyrosine</b>, but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine.</blockquote><blockquote>In the presence of a low iodine intake, thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with * * f is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal, the amounts of <b>di-iodotyrosine</b> and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced.</blockquote></div>
