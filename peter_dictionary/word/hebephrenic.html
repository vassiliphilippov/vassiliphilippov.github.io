            <div class="definition">Relating to or affected by a form of schizophrenia characterized by disorganized behavior, inappropriate or silly affect, and regressive, childlike actions.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>One <b>hebephrenic</b> woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience of pseudo emotion, during which, despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks, I felt only a cold annoyance with her.</blockquote><blockquote>A somewhat less fragmented <b>hebephrenic</b> patient of mine, who used to often seclude herself in her room, often sounded through the closed door - as I would find on passing by, between our sessions - for all the world like two persons, a scolding mother and a defensive child.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, one <b>hebephrenic</b> man used to annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day, or whenever, "You 're welcome ", in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful, "thank you "to him at the end of each session.</blockquote><blockquote>A <b>hebephrenic</b> man used to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his largely silent hours with his therapist.</blockquote><blockquote>It is no coincidence that the <b>hebephrenic</b> patient, the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients, shows, as one of his characteristic symptoms, laughter - laughter which now makes one feel scorned or hated, which now makes one feel like weeping, or which now gives one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair; and which, more often than all these, conveys a welter of feelings which could in no way be conveyed by any number of words, words which are so unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another.</blockquote></div>
