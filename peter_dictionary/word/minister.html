Barstow, ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove manufacturer; Thomas Davis, an uncompromising Garrisonian; the Reverend Augustus Woodbury, a Unitarian <b>minister</b>; the Reverend George T. Day, a Free-Will Baptist; Daniel w. Vaughan, and William H. H. Clements.</blockquote><blockquote>"Know this: the <b>ministers</b> will not yield to the demands of Bern ".</blockquote></div>
