            <div class="definition">A flying insect with a hairy body that collects nectar and pollen, and includes both social species (such as the honeybee) and solitary species.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Apart from the honeybee, practically all <b>bees</b> and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor.</blockquote><blockquote>The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble: honeybees, bumblebees, and other wild <b>bees</b>, and also various kinds of flies.</blockquote><blockquote>The staminate willow catkins, then, provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement, for it provides exactly what the <b>bee</b> queens need to make their beebread, a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed.</blockquote><blockquote>The only exception to this is certain <b>bees</b> that have become parasites.</blockquote><blockquote>Some members of the <b>bee</b> family have become idlers, social parasites that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives.</blockquote></div>
