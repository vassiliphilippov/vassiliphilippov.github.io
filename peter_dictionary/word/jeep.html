N. flag.</blockquote><blockquote>We rode over roads so rough that our <b>Jeep</b> came to rest atop the soil between ruts, all four wheels spinning uselessly.</blockquote><blockquote>And so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing along in a <b>Jeep</b> right behind the Land-Rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas.</blockquote><blockquote>But our two <b>Jeep</b> mates - Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania - were beaming under their coatings of dust.</blockquote></div>
