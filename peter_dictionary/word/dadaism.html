            <div class="definition">An early 20th-century European art movement characterized by irrationality, negation of traditional artistic values, and a rejection of accepted standards of beauty.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky, Cocteau, Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of <b>Dadaism</b> and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.</blockquote></div>
