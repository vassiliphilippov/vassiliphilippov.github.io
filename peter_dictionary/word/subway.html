            <div class="definition">an underground railway system, especially in a city, used for public transportation</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote><b>Subways</b> improved land values without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less (because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot), and reduce the acreage that can be taxed.</blockquote><blockquote>I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind, felt older than my years, and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the <b>subway</b> that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable, tantalizing excitement of Manhattan.</blockquote><blockquote>Times Square, when I ascended to it with my fellow <b>subway</b> travellers (all dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant members), was nearly impassable, the sidewalks swarming with celebrants, with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>in Paris the subway system is called the `metro' and in London it is called the `tube' or the `underground'</blockquote></div>
