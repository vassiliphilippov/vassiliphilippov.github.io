            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There is a break in <b>continuity</b> just before the fourth variation in the "Forellen "movement, and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original SPs.</blockquote><blockquote>The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual <b>continuities</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>But these are dreamed in original action, in some particular <b>continuity</b> which we do n't remember having seen in real life.</blockquote><blockquote>There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original, realistic and unbroken <b>continuity</b> like we experience in dreams.</blockquote><blockquote>Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive <b>continuity</b> to sensory impressions.</blockquote></div>
