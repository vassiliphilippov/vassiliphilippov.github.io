            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Up to the turn of the century, <b>contraception</b> was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary to divine law.</blockquote><blockquote>In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of <b>contraception</b> and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers - physical, moral, and religious - thereby incurred, and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race ".</blockquote><blockquote>In 1930, the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances, <b>contraception</b> might be morally legitimate.</blockquote><blockquote>The general board declared: "Most of the Protestant churches hold <b>contraception</b> and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right.</blockquote></div>
