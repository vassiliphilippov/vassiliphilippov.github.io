            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Obviously hydrophobic (<b>oleophilic</b>) substances such as greases, oils, or particles having a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase.</blockquote><blockquote>Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of <b>oleophilic</b> substances so that the micelle volume may be increased as much as approximately two-fold.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, for aqueous media, we can think of the idealized organic active as an <b>oleophilic</b> or hydrophobic surface-active agent, and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.</blockquote></div>
