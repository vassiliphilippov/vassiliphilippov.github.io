            <div class="definition">A musical composition for an orchestra and a solo instrument, typically in three movements, where the soloist and orchestra interact, often showcasing the soloist's skill.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>As he leads the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra, Schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the Baslot and Rattzhenfuut <b>concertos</b>, including the controversial Tschilwyk cadenza, which was included at the conductor's insistence.</blockquote><blockquote>We attended the premieres of his <b>concertos</b>, symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught, and performed his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.</blockquote><blockquote>Meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist; a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem (The Star-Spangled Banner); a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz <b>concerto</b>; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs!</blockquote></div>
