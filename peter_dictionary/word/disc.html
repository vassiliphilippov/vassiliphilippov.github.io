Basler.</blockquote><blockquote>Complete with crowd effects, interruptions by jet planes, and sundry other touches of realism, this <b>disc</b> displays London's new technique to the best effect.</blockquote><blockquote>Some clue to the character of London's approach in these <b>discs</b> may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word "percussion "or "percussive ".</blockquote><blockquote>Big Band Percussion (SP 44002) seemed one of the least attractive <b>discs</b> - the arrangements just did n't have so much character as the others.</blockquote></div>
