            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The absurd notion that <b>demythologization</b> entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention.</blockquote><blockquote>However, even if the latent demand for <b>demythologization</b> is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming, at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.</blockquote><blockquote>When we say, then, that today, in our situation, the demand for <b>demythologization</b> must be accepted without condition, we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement.</blockquote><blockquote>If the demand for <b>demythologization</b> is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally, the position of the "right "is clearly untenable.</blockquote><blockquote>Whereas Bultmann's "center "position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone, the general position of the "right ", as represented, say, by Karl Barth, involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for <b>demythologization</b> and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered.</blockquote></div>
