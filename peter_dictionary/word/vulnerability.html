            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>vulnerability</b> of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the "folksy spirit "of Protestant religious life; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the "impersonal "Roman Catholic parish.</blockquote><blockquote>We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently, the <b>vulnerability</b> to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations; actually, there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations, as we shall see in another connection.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>vulnerability</b> of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore, to the principle of economic integration.</blockquote></div>
