            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Now the thing for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering currants such as the red Ribes sanguineum of our Pacific Northwest, or otherwise a good sloe tree, or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom, preferably one with male or staminate <b>catkins</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Each male willow <b>catkin</b> is composed of a large number of small flowers.</blockquote><blockquote>It is not difficult to see that the stamens of the <b>catkin</b> are always arranged in pairs, and that each individual flower is nothing but one such pair standing on a green, black tipped little scale.</blockquote><blockquote>The staminate willow <b>catkins</b>, then, provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement, for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread, a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed.</blockquote><blockquote>Quite often, honeybees form a majority on the willow <b>catkins</b>.</blockquote></div>
