            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Something of this can be learned from "The Way to the Churchyard " (1901), an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing <b>cyclist</b> causes him to die of a stroke or seizure.</blockquote><blockquote>This strange person quarrels with a <b>cyclist</b> because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>cyclist</b>, a sufficiently commonplace young fellow, is not named but identified simply as "Life "- that and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him.</blockquote><blockquote>His rage assumes a religious form; that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness, Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life - not only the <b>cyclist</b> now, but the audience, the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed ".</blockquote><blockquote>Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the <b>cyclist</b>, but also because God will not stop him; as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments: "His justice is not of this world ".</blockquote></div>
