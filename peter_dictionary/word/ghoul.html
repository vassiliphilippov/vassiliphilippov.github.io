F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer.</blockquote><blockquote>"Unfortunately ", says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens, who has prosecuted many device quacks, "the <b>ghouls</b> who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ".</blockquote></div>
