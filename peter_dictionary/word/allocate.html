Vandiver <b>allocated</b> last year from the state surplus.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy has been modified - and large new sums <b>allocated</b> - to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.</blockquote></div>
