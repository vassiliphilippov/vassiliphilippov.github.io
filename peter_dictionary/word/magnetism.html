            <div class="definition">The physical phenomenon produced by the motion of electric charge, resulting in attractive and repulsive forces between objects, especially involving iron and other materials, and characterized by magnetic fields.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and <b>magnetism</b> is here first indicated.</blockquote><blockquote>There, forces are more latent than in electricity, and less than in <b>magnetism</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>But in such an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and <b>magnetism</b> were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is contrary to it.</blockquote><blockquote>One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its <b>magnetism</b> by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.</blockquote><blockquote>It is also found that <b>magnetism</b> exists in all bodies of nature, as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb.</blockquote></div>
