            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Deane Beman, the National Amateur champion, and all the <b>metropolitan</b> district champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title-holder, also will receive awards.</blockquote><blockquote>Many years have passed since a <b>Metropolitan</b> audience heard anything comparable.</blockquote><blockquote>New Yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the <b>metropolitan</b> newspapers.</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a <b>metropolitan</b> area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.</blockquote><blockquote>The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so high in <b>metropolitan</b> areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive; they can lose higher - and lower status members from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration.</blockquote></div>
