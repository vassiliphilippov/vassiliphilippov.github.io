            <div class="definition">An instrument for measuring temperature, often consisting of a glass tube with a liquid that expands or contracts as the temperature increases or decreases.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The Bureau is pursuing an active program to provide a temperature scale and <b>thermometer</b> calibration services in the range 1.5 to 20 * * f.</blockquote><blockquote>Carbon resistors and impurity doped germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary <b>thermometers</b> in the liquid helium temperature region.</blockquote><blockquote>Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure <b>thermometer</b> whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.</blockquote><blockquote>The reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure <b>thermometers</b> have been investigated in conjunction with a "constant temperature "liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f.</blockquote><blockquote>It has also been observed, in helium 2,, that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure <b>thermometer</b>.</blockquote></div>
