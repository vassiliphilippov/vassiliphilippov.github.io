            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by <b>oxidation</b> of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid.</blockquote><blockquote>In the midwest, <b>oxidation</b> ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas.</blockquote><blockquote>The high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the <b>oxidation</b> pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume.</blockquote><blockquote>Research at Fayette, Missouri on <b>oxidation</b> ponds has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mg / l with loadings from 8 to 120 lb BOD / day / acre.</blockquote><blockquote>Since experience indicates that effluents from <b>oxidation</b> ponds do not create major problems at these BOD concentrations, the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds.</blockquote></div>
