            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>1) Every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been, creating <b>legends</b> about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions.</blockquote><blockquote>Its folklore and <b>legend</b>, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to become a cohesive force for national identification.</blockquote><blockquote>Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into <b>legend</b> and developing appropriate national heroes.</blockquote><blockquote>But we must never forget, most of the appropriate heroes and their <b>legends</b> were created overnight, to answer immediate needs, almost always with conscious aims and ends.</blockquote><blockquote>1) Most of the <b>legends</b> that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all.</blockquote></div>
