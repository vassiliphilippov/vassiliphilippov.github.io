            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Microscopically, both kidneys showed many small <b>cortical</b> scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of <b>cortical</b> strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored.</blockquote><blockquote>Consequently, if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level, the lessened hypothalamic <b>cortical</b> discharges lead to a diminished state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharges.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, a low intensity of hypothalamic <b>cortical</b> discharges prevails in sleep and a high one during wakefulness, resulting in synchronous EEG potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition.</blockquote><blockquote>We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with respect to the autonomic somatic downward discharge as well as regarding the hypothalamic <b>cortical</b> discharge.</blockquote></div>
