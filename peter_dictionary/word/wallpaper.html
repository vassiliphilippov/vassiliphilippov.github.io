            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It was for this reason, and no other that I can see, that in September 1912, Braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation woodgrain <b>wallpaper</b> to a drawing on paper, instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet the violent immediacy of the <b>wallpaper</b> strips pasted to the paper, and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering, manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not "jump ".</blockquote><blockquote>At the same time, the <b>wallpaper</b> strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them, and by their placing in relation to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing, and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining.</blockquote></div>
