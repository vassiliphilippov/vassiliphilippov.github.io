(Mouvement Populaire) appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed without support from <b>progressive</b> elements in the party.</blockquote><blockquote>Lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide, minority parties, such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the <b>progressive</b> Istiqlal faction in 1958, clamor for elections when out of power, but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power.</blockquote><blockquote>As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen, the U.M.C.I.A. was generally favored against the more <b>progressive</b>, labor based U.N.F.P. The newer party campaigned heavily, while the older, more confident party expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years.</blockquote><blockquote>But rather a genuine, <b>progressive</b> advance
in corrections and rehabilitation.</blockquote></div>
