            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob uprisings in the streets, in <b>parliaments</b>, in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level.</blockquote><blockquote>In municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of <b>parliament</b> - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary.</blockquote></div>
