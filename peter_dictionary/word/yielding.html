            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>One is so accustomed to think of men as the privileged who need but ask and receive, and women as submissive and <b>yielding</b>, that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned, and we condemn the woman as a coquette.</blockquote><blockquote>She could not resist the opportunity "of showing her superiority in argument over a man "which she had remarked as one of the "feminine follies "of Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness "to think of men as the privileged "and "women as submissive and <b>yielding</b> ", felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College - until once, in sheer desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything.</blockquote><blockquote>And he certainly could n't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the <b>yielding</b> - yes, and credible fool he had every right to expect.</blockquote></div>
