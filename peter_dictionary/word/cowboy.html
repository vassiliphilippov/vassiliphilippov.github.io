            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>cowboy</b> films, the cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; these films and these sequences are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.</blockquote><blockquote>They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property, thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the Vermejo, and yet the <b>cowboys</b> protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot.</blockquote><blockquote>This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering <b>cowboy</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Like the <b>cowboy</b> in Stephen Crane's "Blue Hotel ", we run around crying, "Well, I did n't do anything, did I "?</blockquote><blockquote>For Tom Horn, it turned out, had a number of rancher and <b>cowboy</b> witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing.</blockquote></div>
