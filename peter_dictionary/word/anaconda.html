            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths, starting with the smallest (boa constrictor) and ending with the largest (<b>anaconda</b>).</blockquote><blockquote>Data on the former are scanty, but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes born at a length greater than that of any of the others, thereby lending support to the belief that the <b>anaconda</b> does, indeed, attain the greatest length.</blockquote><blockquote>For four of the six (the <b>anaconda</b> and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length, the boa constrictor being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage.</blockquote><blockquote>Let us speculate a little on the maximum size of the <b>anaconda</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>There are few data on the boa constrictor, those for the <b>anaconda</b> are unconvincing, and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python.</blockquote></div>
