            <div class="definition">The hero of the novel by Cervantes, noted for his chivalrous but impractical pursuit of idealistic goals; also used to refer to a person who is extravagantly idealistic, unrealistic, or impractical.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel de Cervantes' "<b>Don Quixote</b> "is the brilliant Russian spectacle, done in wide screen and color, which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses.</blockquote><blockquote>Nikolai Cherkasov, the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible, performs the lanky <b>Don Quixote</b>, and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.</blockquote><blockquote>True, the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half, before <b>Don Quixote</b> goes to the duke's court.</blockquote></div>
