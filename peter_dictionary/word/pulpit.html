            <div class="definition">A raised platform in a church or chapel from which the preacher delivers a sermon; more generally, any elevated platform giving prominence to a speaker.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his <b>pulpit</b>; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote><blockquote>His being and His will - Stevie could not divide God from his Papa - illumined every parish face, turned the choir into a band of angels, and the <b>pulpit</b> into the tollgate to Heaven.</blockquote></div>
