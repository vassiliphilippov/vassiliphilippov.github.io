            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>A state of parasympathetic "<b>tuning</b> "of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli, but leads also to an autonomic reversal: a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of tuning a parasympathetic response!</blockquote><blockquote>A state of parasympathetic "tuning "of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase in the parasympathetic reactivity this structure to direct and reflexly induced stimuli, but leads also to an autonomic reversal: a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in this state of <b>tuning</b> a parasympathetic response!</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, conditioned reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level, and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic "<b>tuning</b> "are observed.</blockquote></div>
