            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Charles Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large <b>plantation</b>, well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age.</blockquote><blockquote>The planter aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his <b>plantation</b> dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature.</blockquote><blockquote>The myth of the Southern <b>plantation</b> has had only a tangential relation with actuality, as Francis Pendleton Gaines showed forty years ago, and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance as something real than has generally been supposed.</blockquote><blockquote>Faulkner's low-class characters had but few counterparts in earlier Southern novels dealing with <b>plantation</b> life.</blockquote></div>
