            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Recent studies by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine <b>aerator</b> could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer.</blockquote><blockquote>The pilot plant was equipped with a 3 - hp turbine <b>aerator</b> (Figure 2).</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>aerator</b> had a variable speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds.</blockquote><blockquote>The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine <b>aerator</b> to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents.</blockquote><blockquote>The periods of high effluent BOD occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the <b>aerator</b> resulted.</blockquote></div>
