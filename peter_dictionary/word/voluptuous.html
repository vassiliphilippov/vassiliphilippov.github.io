            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The wife, Amra, and her lover are both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, "<b>voluptuous</b> "and "indolent ", possibly "a mischief maker ", with "a kind of luxurious cunning "to set against her apparent simplicity, her "bird like brain ".</blockquote><blockquote>The monk Savonarola, brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art shop of M. Bluthenzweig; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a <b>voluptuous</b> style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress.</blockquote><blockquote>She was a living doll and no mistake - the blue-black bang, the wide cheekbones, olive flushed, that betrayed the Cherokee strain in her Midwestern lineage, and the mouth whose only fault, in the novelist's carping phrase, was that the lower lip was a trifle too <b>voluptuous</b>.</blockquote></div>
