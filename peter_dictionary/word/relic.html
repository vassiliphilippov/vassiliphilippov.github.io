Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B.C..) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken <b>relic</b>, and corrected an error in its identification.</blockquote><blockquote>Some time later the missing part of the <b>relic</b> was found and the complete inscription, together with other new evidence, fully corroborated the ancient priest's information.</blockquote></div>
