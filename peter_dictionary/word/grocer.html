J. Hapgood to Burton and Graves' store in Manchester - "Get and send by stage sure four pounds best Porterhouse or sirloin steak, for Mrs. Hapgood send six sweet oranges ".</blockquote><blockquote>They buy some supplies from our colored <b>grocers</b> and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen in town ".</blockquote><blockquote>Our suspicions eventually centered, by the process of elimination, on a <b>grocer</b>'s boy, a thoroughly bad hat, who delivered cartons to the people overhead.</blockquote><blockquote>One would need to test this proposition carefully; after all, the large (and probably unreliable) Reader's Digest literature on the "most unforgettable character I ever met "deals with village <b>grocers</b>, country doctors, favorite if illiterate aunts, and so forth.</blockquote></div>
