            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>THE DENVER-AREA TV audience was <b>privileged</b> to see Mays' four home runs, thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home.</blockquote><blockquote>The P.D.I. and later the Popular Movement protected the Istiqlal's "<b>privileged</b> position "until the fall of Balafrej, and then the Istiqlal used the same argument, which it had previously ignored, against the pro U.N.F.P. tendencies of the Ibrahim government.</blockquote><blockquote>One is so accustomed to think of men as the <b>privileged</b> who need but ask and receive, and women as submissive and yielding, that our sympathies are usually enlisted on the side of the man whose love is not returned, and we condemn the woman as a coquette.</blockquote><blockquote>She could not resist the opportunity "of showing her superiority in argument over a man "which she had remarked as one of the "feminine follies "of Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness "to think of men as the <b>privileged</b> "and "women as submissive and yielding ", felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College - until once, in sheer desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything.</blockquote></div>
