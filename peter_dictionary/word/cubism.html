            <div class="definition">A style of art and an early 20th-century movement originating in France, characterized by the depiction of objects using geometric forms and the breakdown of subjects into abstract planes.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>For it had turned out, by a further paradox of <b>Cubism</b>, that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Cubism</b>, in its 1911 - 1912 phase (which the French, with justice, call "hermetic ") was on the verge of abstract art.</blockquote><blockquote>But the inner, formal logic of <b>Cubism</b>, as it worked itself out through the collage, had just as much to do with shaping their decision.</blockquote><blockquote>Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil, and transformed by this translation, did <b>Cubism</b> become an affair of positive color and flat, interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to, if not the illusion of, unmistakable three-dimensional identities.</blockquote><blockquote>This he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage (and of <b>Cubism</b> in general) literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane.</blockquote></div>
