            <div class="definition">A group of people who gather regularly for religious worship at a particular church, synagogue, or other place of worship.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university, following Anglican evensong, at which there was a <b>congregation</b> of twelve, he celebrated Mass before more than a hundred.</blockquote><blockquote>It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church, and to hear almost everyone in church <b>congregations</b> reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass.</blockquote><blockquote>He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his <b>congregation</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>A <b>congregation</b> survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership; that is, when it can preserve economic integration.</blockquote><blockquote>Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a <b>congregation</b>, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force, but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition.</blockquote></div>
