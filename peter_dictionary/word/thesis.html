            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the "right ", as represented by Barth, rests on the following <b>thesis</b>: The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that (1) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation; (2) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation; and (3) in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's point of view, are mythological.</blockquote><blockquote>The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the <b>thesis</b> that death cannot be only a punishment, for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change.</blockquote><blockquote>Important as was Mr. O' Donnell's essay, his <b>thesis</b> is so restricting as to deny Faulkner the stature which he obviously has.</blockquote></div>
