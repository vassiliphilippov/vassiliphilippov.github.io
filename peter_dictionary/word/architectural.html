            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>During the making recently of an important Biblical film, some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors, but of <b>architectural</b> developments, sports arenas, vehicles, and other paraphernalia were compiled, consulted, and complied with.</blockquote><blockquote>The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that, therefore, the interior designer is incapable of understanding the <b>architectural</b> principles involved in planning the interior of a building.</blockquote><blockquote>It is true that most <b>architectural</b> schools have five year courses, some even have six or more.</blockquote><blockquote>The element of public danger which enters so largely into <b>architectural</b> certification, however, would demand a prolonged study of structure.</blockquote></div>
