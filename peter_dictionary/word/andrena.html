            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There are about 200 different kinds of <b>Andrena</b> in Europe alone.</blockquote><blockquote>After having mated, an <b>Andrena</b> female digs a hole straight down into the ground, forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil.</blockquote><blockquote>The development of the <b>Andrena</b> larvae is very rapid, so that by the end of spring they have already pupated and become adults.</blockquote><blockquote>Although <b>Andrena</b> is gregarious, so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together, we must still call it a solitary bee.</blockquote><blockquote>On the basis of its life history, we like to think that <b>Andrena</b> is more primitive than the bumblebees.</blockquote></div>
