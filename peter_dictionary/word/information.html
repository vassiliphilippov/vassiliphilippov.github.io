V. Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B.C..) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of <b>information</b> about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification.</blockquote></div>
