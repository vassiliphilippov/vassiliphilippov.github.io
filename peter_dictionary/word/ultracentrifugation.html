            <div class="definition">The process of subjecting substances to centrifugal force at very high speeds, typically to separate components based on their density, commonly used in scientific and medical laboratories.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>These include low-temperature ethanol (Cohn) fractionation, electrophoresis, <b>ultracentrifugation</b> and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses.</blockquote><blockquote>Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical <b>ultracentrifugation</b> were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, ionic strength 0.154.</blockquote><blockquote>For preparative <b>ultracentrifugation</b>, fractions from the column were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis to volumes of 1 ml or less, transferred to cellulose tubes and diluted to 12 ml with isotonic saline.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Ultracentrifugation</b> was then carried out in a Spinco model L ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min, refrigeration being used throughout the run.</blockquote></div>
