            <div class="definition">A person or business that sells goods to the public in relatively small quantities for use or consumption rather than for resale.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>One, by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17000 <b>retailers</b> who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead, <b>retailers</b> would sign a certificate of correctness, violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison, plus a $ 1000 fine.</blockquote><blockquote>SBA loans, which may be made to small manufacturers, small business pools, wholesalers, <b>retailers</b>, service establishments and other small businesses (when financing is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms), are to finance business construction, conversion, or expansion; the purchase of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or materials; or to supply working capital.</blockquote><blockquote>If the <b>retailer</b> and hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing, however, his dollar volume continues to rise, and it is dollars which you put in the bank.</blockquote><blockquote>Fear of the competition - always a great motivating force in the American economy - makes <b>retailers</b> who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new branches.</blockquote></div>
