            <div class="definition">The act of forcing a liquid, gas, or other substance into something, usually by means of a syringe or similar device, under pressure.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Gas <b>injection</b> through a porous anode (transpiration cooling) not only feeds back the energy transferred to the anode by the above mentioned processes, but also modifies the conditions in the arc itself.</blockquote><blockquote>Such a dual derivation was strikingly demonstrated during the <b>injection</b> process where initial filling would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once.</blockquote><blockquote>In criticism of the latter's views, his conclusions were based upon dog lung <b>injection</b> studies in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the <b>injection</b> of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored.</blockquote></div>
