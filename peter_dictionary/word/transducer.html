            <div class="definition">a device that converts energy from one form into another, especially for the purposes of measurement, control, or signal transfer, such as converting sound into electrical signals</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal <b>transducers</b> at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy.</blockquote><blockquote>It is also possible to utilize a pressure <b>transducer</b>, mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself.</blockquote><blockquote>In this novel arrangement the "pill "is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure sensing <b>transducer</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>In medicine the frequencies are much higher, <b>transducers</b> and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>transducer</b> is coupled to the body through a water bath, not shown.</blockquote></div>
