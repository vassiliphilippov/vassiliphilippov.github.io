            <div class="definition">Relating to or characteristic of cubism, an early 20th-century art movement known for its use of geometric shapes and fragmented representation of subjects.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Through 1911 and 1912, as the <b>Cubist</b> facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny, the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances.</blockquote><blockquote>Depicted, <b>Cubist</b> flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal, undepicted kind, but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind - and it does so, moreover, without depriving the latter of its literalness; rather, it underpins and reinforces that literalness, re-creates it.</blockquote><blockquote>In order to be saved, plasticity had had to be isolated; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the <b>Cubist</b> method, the subject itself became largely unrecognizable.</blockquote><blockquote>Synthetic Cubism began with Picasso alone, late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the point at which he finally took the lead in <b>Cubist</b> innovation away from Braque, never again to relinquish it.</blockquote><blockquote>And it is thought by many who think about such things that Quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with Monet, progressed through Kandinsky and the <b>cubist</b> Picasso, and blossomed just recently in Pollock and De Kooning.</blockquote></div>
