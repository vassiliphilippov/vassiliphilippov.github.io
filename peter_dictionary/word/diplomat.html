            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In all the bitter in-fighting, the squabbles over election procedures, the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme, the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled <b>diplomat</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Keo, once a <b>diplomat</b> in Paris and Washington, was Commissioner of Rural Affairs.</blockquote><blockquote>They were not <b>diplomats</b> or jazz musicians, or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo montage displays, but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Hugh Cooper, Thomas Campbell, the International Harvester Co., and David W. Griffith.</blockquote><blockquote>The wrong man in the wrong position, perhaps even in a junior position abroad, can be a source of great harm to our policy; the attitudes of a U.N. delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate housing in New York City, or of a foreign <b>diplomat</b> in similar circumstances in our Capital, can be easily be directed against the United States and all that it stands for.</blockquote></div>
