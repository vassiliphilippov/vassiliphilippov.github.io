            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In ever greater numbers, factories are locating in the <b>suburbs</b> or in "industrial parks "removed from the city's political jurisdiction.</blockquote><blockquote>The appeal of the <b>suburb</b> is particularly strong for heavy industry, which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor.</blockquote><blockquote>The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical, that the choice of location in the <b>suburbs</b> is as important as it was downtown, and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches.</blockquote><blockquote>Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St. Louis have been driving across the Mississippi, through the heart of downtown St. Louis and out to the western <b>suburbs</b> for major shopping, simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town.</blockquote><blockquote>In their book American Skyline, Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was what made the modern <b>suburb</b> a possibility - a fine ironical argument, when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote.</blockquote></div>
