            <div class="definition">The act or process of cleaning something, especially using water and soap or detergent.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Exclusive of esthetic values, such as high - or low foam level, perfume content, etc., the requirements for the organic active used in <b>washing</b> textiles are high.</blockquote><blockquote>This is best demonstrated by practical <b>washing</b> tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation.</blockquote><blockquote>A good formulation will keep the clothes clean and white after many <b>washings</b>; whereas, with a poor formulation, the clothes exhibit a build-up of "tattle-tale grey "and dirty spots - sometimes with bad results even after the first wash.</blockquote><blockquote>Since practical <b>washing</b> procedures are both lengthy and expensive, a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents.</blockquote><blockquote>In this way, numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance (whiteness) of the cloth swatches before and after <b>washing</b>.</blockquote></div>
