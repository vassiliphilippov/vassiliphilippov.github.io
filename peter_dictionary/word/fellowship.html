            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The feeling of individual inferiority, defeat, or humilation growing out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly, but all-victorious Father-God, as well as by sympathetic <b>fellowship</b> with others who share this faith, and by opportunities in religious acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.</blockquote><blockquote>The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping <b>fellowship</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>If it were primarily a believing <b>fellowship</b>, it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism (with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do.</blockquote><blockquote>The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian <b>fellowship</b> and the transmutation of mission to co-optation.</blockquote><blockquote>It could be argued that any <b>fellowship</b> which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes.</blockquote></div>
