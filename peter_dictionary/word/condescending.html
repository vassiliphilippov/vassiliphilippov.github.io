            <div class="definition">Having or showing an attitude of patronizing superiority; treating others as if they are less important or intelligent.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>For example, one hebephrenic man used to annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day, or whenever, "You 're welcome ", in a notably <b>condescending</b> fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful, "thank you "to him at the end of each session.</blockquote><blockquote>Eventually it became clear to me, partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my condescension to me somewhat more directly, that this man, with his <b>condescending</b>, "You 're welcome ", was very accurately personifying an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own demeanor, over these months, on each of these occasions when I had bid him good-bye with the consoling note, each time, that the healing Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered again on the morrow.</blockquote></div>
