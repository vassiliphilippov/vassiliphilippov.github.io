            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>According to his own testimony, he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous "<b>blots</b> "of color of a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether.</blockquote><blockquote>Then he might finally recognize it, apparently by combining the visual <b>blot</b>, actually being seen, with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements.</blockquote><blockquote>As one would surmise, the procedure, however, could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough, so that the corresponding visual <b>blots</b> and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape, which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference.</blockquote><blockquote>Men, trees, automobiles, houses, and so on - objects continually confronted in everyday life - had each its characteristic <b>blot</b> appearance and became easily recognizable, at the very beginning of tracing, by an inference as to what each was.</blockquote><blockquote>Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly, without the tracing motions, solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the <b>blot</b> like things which appeared in his visual experience.</blockquote></div>
