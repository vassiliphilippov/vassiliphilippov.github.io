            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our <b>wakeful</b> thoughts.</blockquote><blockquote>Every dream, and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of <b>wakeful</b> thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.</blockquote><blockquote>A "mental image "subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in <b>wakeful</b> thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension.</blockquote><blockquote>When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the <b>wakeful</b> world, it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep.</blockquote><blockquote>The old nightmare which had caused him so many <b>wakeful</b> hours came charging in on him once more, only this time he could n't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>a policy of open-eyed awareness</blockquote><blockquote>the vigilant eye of the town watch</blockquote><blockquote>there was a watchful dignity in the room</blockquote><blockquote>a watchful parent with a toddler in tow</blockquote></div>
