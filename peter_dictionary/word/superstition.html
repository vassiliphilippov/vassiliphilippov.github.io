            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The objectification of the world of spirit in popular <b>superstition</b> had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support.</blockquote><blockquote>In doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable popular <b>superstitions</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>It has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, <b>superstitions</b>, rhymes and such literary forms of expression.</blockquote><blockquote>As a result, most people do n't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is; they see it as a potpourri of charming, moral legends and patriotic anecdotes, with a <b>superstition</b> or remedy thrown in here and there.</blockquote><blockquote>In the first place, a good many writers who are said to use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional <b>superstition</b> or tale.</blockquote></div>
