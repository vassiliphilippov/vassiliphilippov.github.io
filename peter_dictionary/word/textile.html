            <div class="definition">A type of fabric or cloth, especially one produced by weaving, knitting, or felting fibers.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture, furniture design, <b>textiles</b> and color is also desirable.</blockquote><blockquote>There are considerable differences between the requirements for <b>textile</b> and hard surface cleaning.</blockquote><blockquote>Exclusive of esthetic values, such as high - or low foam level, perfume content, etc., the requirements for the organic active used in washing <b>textiles</b> are high.</blockquote><blockquote>As is the case with the surface-active agent, the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing <b>textiles</b> are also high.</blockquote><blockquote>The rows of animals and birds, in particular, suggest awareness of Oriental animal friezes, transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and <b>textiles</b>, but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>the fabric in the curtains was light and semitransparent</blockquote><blockquote>woven cloth originated in Mesopotamia around 5000 BC</blockquote><blockquote>she measured off enough material for a dress</blockquote></div>
