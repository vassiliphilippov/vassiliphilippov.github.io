E..) who had been sensitized 6 years previously.</blockquote><blockquote>Anti - A and anti - B activities were determined in fractions from the sera of group A, group B or group O <b>donors</b> by the following tube agglutination methods.</blockquote><blockquote>The insoluble material which precipitated during dialysis against starting buffer always showed intense agglutinin activity, regardless of the blood group of the <b>donor</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>When the early part of the gradient was flattened, either by using the gradient shown in Fig. 2 or by allowing the "cone sphere "gradient to become established more slowly, Region 2 activity could sometimes be separated into two areas (<b>donors</b> P. J. and R. S., Fig. 1 and E. M., Fig. 2).</blockquote></div>
