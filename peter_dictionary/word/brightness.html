            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk <b>brightness</b> temperature by less than 1 ` K.</blockquote><blockquote>Not all the observers have used the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar <b>brightness</b> distribution when reducing the data, and this, together with differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers, must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness temperatures.</blockquote><blockquote>In the observations at 4.3 mm (Coates, 1959 a), the diameter of the antenna beam, 6' .7, was small enough to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface, and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar <b>brightness</b> distribution at three lunar phases.</blockquote><blockquote>The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average <b>brightness</b> temperature of the moon over the antenna beam (assuming that the brightness temperature of the sky is negligible) was found, by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram, to be 0.85.</blockquote><blockquote>The ratio of the measured antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam (assuming that the <b>brightness</b> temperature of the sky is negligible) was found, by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram, to be 0.85.</blockquote></div>
