            <div class="definition">the property of a material that causes a single ray of light to split into two rays traveling in different directions and with different polarizations when it passes through</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function difference * * f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is compatible with the information obtained from optical <b>birefringence</b> studies of fluids undergoing shear.</blockquote><blockquote>Essentially these <b>birefringence</b> studies show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45 ` to the direction of shear, and as the rate of shear increases, the direction of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction of shear.</blockquote><blockquote>This is, of course, a similar type of behavior to that indicated by <b>birefringence</b> studies.</blockquote></div>
