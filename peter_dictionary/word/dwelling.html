Goodwin, jeweler and watchmaker, became the town's first telegrapher in a <b>dwelling</b> he built for himself and his business "two doors north of the Equinox House "or "one door north of the Bank, Manchester, Vermont ".</blockquote><blockquote>Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas <b>dwellings</b> opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets.</blockquote><blockquote>We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited <b>dwellings</b> whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence.</blockquote><blockquote>We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between <b>dwellings</b> is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2.</blockquote><blockquote>In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point like f in Figure 2 would (other things being equal) be the <b>dwelling</b> place for the community leader, while e and h would house the next most important citizens.</blockquote></div>
