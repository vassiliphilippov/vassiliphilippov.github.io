            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It has recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and <b>planets</b> as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres.</blockquote><blockquote>Observations of the radio emission of a <b>planet</b> which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface.</blockquote><blockquote>Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these <b>planets</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the <b>planet</b>, although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence.</blockquote><blockquote>Of the remaining <b>planets</b>, only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources, and not very much information is available.</blockquote></div>
