            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, <b>shrewd</b> talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem of suffering "); the miraculous way in which music, revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.</blockquote><blockquote>A smart, <b>shrewd</b> and ambitious young man, well connected, and with a knack for getting in the good graces of important people, he was bound to go far.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>a smart businessman</blockquote><blockquote>an astute tenant always reads the small print in a lease</blockquote><blockquote>he was too shrewd to go along with them on a road that could lead only to their overthrow</blockquote></div>
