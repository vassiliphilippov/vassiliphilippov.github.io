            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern, it is not modern communism or even modern <b>socialism</b>, as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice.</blockquote><blockquote>Here, Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of <b>Socialism</b> - producing music for the masses.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>socialism</b> implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution, freedom from want and fear, seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution, or of the Jacksonian frontier.</blockquote><blockquote>However, it is important to trace the philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and <b>socialism</b> and the influence of the latter on the former.</blockquote><blockquote>And the USSR existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical <b>socialism</b>, the ultimate exemplar.</blockquote></div>
