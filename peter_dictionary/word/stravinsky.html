            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World - the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated - the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America - the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff, <b>Stravinsky</b>, Koussevitzky, Cocteau, Picasso - the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art - the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.</blockquote><blockquote>His fellow countryman, Igor <b>Stravinsky</b>, certainly did not.</blockquote><blockquote>Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while <b>Stravinsky</b> (who leaped into fame like a young giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?</blockquote><blockquote>When <b>Stravinsky</b> shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons, many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures.</blockquote><blockquote>But time is running out, and many of <b>Stravinsky</b>'s admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma.</blockquote></div>
