            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned <b>magician</b> and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough.</blockquote><blockquote>The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French <b>magician</b>, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin S. Porter.</blockquote><blockquote>Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a <b>magician</b>, discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film.</blockquote><blockquote>This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling, <b>magician</b>'s tricks produced on film.</blockquote></div>
