M. on the third of August, A. D. 32.</blockquote><blockquote>As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional was, before the modern period of technical specialization, one who "<b>professed</b> "to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills.</blockquote></div>
