            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends - expanding <b>interdependence</b> on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings.</blockquote><blockquote>The motifs of impersonal <b>interdependence</b> and insulation of residential communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb, Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis.</blockquote><blockquote>More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the <b>interdependence</b> of metropolitan life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples.</blockquote><blockquote>Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding <b>interdependence</b> of the metropolis.</blockquote><blockquote>Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan <b>interdependence</b> with residential exclusion.</blockquote></div>
