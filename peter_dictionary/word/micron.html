            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few <b>microns</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Very small particles, however, in a size range of 1 to 4 <b>microns</b> in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs.</blockquote><blockquote>Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 <b>microns</b> in size were disseminated.</blockquote><blockquote>A satisfactory cloud was produced even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 <b>microns</b>.</blockquote></div>
