            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The actual surface becomes both ground and background, and it turns out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place left for a <b>three-dimensional</b> illusion is in front of, upon, the surface.</blockquote><blockquote>In the Analytical phase of their Cubism, Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it - to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific <b>three-dimensional</b> entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself.</blockquote><blockquote>If, on the other hand, they opted for representation, it had to be representation per se - representation as image pure and simple, without connotations (at least, without more than schematic ones) of the <b>three-dimensional</b> space in which the objects represented originally existed.</blockquote><blockquote>Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil, and transformed by this translation, did Cubism become an affair of positive color and flat, interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to, if not the illusion of, unmistakable <b>three-dimensional</b> identities.</blockquote><blockquote>One of my virtues or vices is a sort of <b>three-dimensional</b> imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color.</blockquote></div>
