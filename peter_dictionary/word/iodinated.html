            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In the absence of additions to the homogenate, the product formed is an <b>iodinated</b> particulate protein (Fawcett and Kirkwood, 1953; Taurog, Potter and Chaikoff, 1955; Taurog, Potter, Tong, and Chaikoff, 1956; Serif and Kirkwood, 1958; De Groot and Carvalho, 1960).</blockquote><blockquote>In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins (chiefly thyroglobulin) are <b>iodinated</b> and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated.</blockquote><blockquote>In the thyroid gland it appears that proteins (chiefly thyroglobulin) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not <b>iodinated</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination, for in certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially no <b>iodinated</b> thyroglobulin, a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments (Wolff, Robbins and Rall, 1959).</blockquote><blockquote>This appears to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly <b>iodinated</b> thyroglobulin.</blockquote></div>
