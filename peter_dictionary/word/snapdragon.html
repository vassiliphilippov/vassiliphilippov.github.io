            <div class="definition">A garden plant of the genus Antirrhinum, with brightly colored flowers that resemble the face of a dragon and can be made to 'snap' open and shut.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Pale yellow <b>snapdragons</b> that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red and yellow columbines whose round tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made "gloves "on the ends of ten waggling fingers.</blockquote></div>

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p class="etymology-body">Named for the dragon-like appearance of the flower and its 'snapping' action when squeezed.</p>
