            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Berman, whose <b>fame</b> has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist, proved himself very much at home in musical comedy.</blockquote><blockquote>How, for example, could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau would find himself when, soon after the furor of his first Discourse, he acquired still another title to <b>fame</b>?</blockquote><blockquote>Ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it, Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to <b>fame</b> as the result of a successful opera.</blockquote><blockquote>Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while Stravinsky (who leaped into <b>fame</b> like a young giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?</blockquote><blockquote>Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning <b>fame</b> at the battle of Tippecanoe, Anglo-Saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier.</blockquote></div>
