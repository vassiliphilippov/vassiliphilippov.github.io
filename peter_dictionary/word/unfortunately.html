Stephens, who has prosecuted many device quacks, "the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ".</blockquote><blockquote><b>Unfortunately</b>, few of the artists (writers, movie producers, dramatists and musicians) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways.</blockquote></div>
