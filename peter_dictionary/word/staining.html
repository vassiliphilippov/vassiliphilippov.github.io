F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>However, the nonspecific <b>staining</b> by the * * f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining of small amounts of WTV antigen.</blockquote><blockquote>However, the nonspecific staining by the * * f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused with the <b>staining</b> of small amounts of WTV antigen.</blockquote><blockquote>Two absorptions of * * f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of * * f (which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride), NS and * * f with crown gall tissue powder, or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of <b>staining</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Rinsing the sections with PBS before layering the intermediate sera did not improve the <b>staining</b> reaction.</blockquote></div>
