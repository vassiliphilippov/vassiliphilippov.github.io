            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, it seems to me, have a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected: "For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love (and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem) and if it is to talk of anger and murder (and yet not aim at arousing anger and indignation) - then it may be that the <b>poetic</b> way of dealing with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification, compounding, or magnification, or any direct assault upon the affections at all.</blockquote></div>
