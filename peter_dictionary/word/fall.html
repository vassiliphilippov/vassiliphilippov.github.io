            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for him, as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself with the <b>fall</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the <b>fall</b>; for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.</blockquote><blockquote>In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the <b>Fall</b> of Man.</blockquote></div>
