            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It is not easy for the therapist to discern when, in the patient's communicating, an <b>introject</b> has appeared and is holding sway.</blockquote><blockquote>At another phase in the therapy, when a pathogenic mother <b>introject</b> began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene, she muttered in a low but intense voice, to herself, "I hate that woman inside me "!</blockquote><blockquote>What had been an unmanageably powerful <b>introject</b> was now, despite its continuing charge of energy disconcerting to me, sufficiently within control of her ego that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like.</blockquote><blockquote>Earlier, this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety of <b>introjects</b> that at times, when she was in her room alone, it would sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in the room, as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice.</blockquote><blockquote>Particularly hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which the patient is manifesting an <b>introject</b> traceable to something in the therapist, some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself only poorly aware, and the recognition of which, as a part of himself, he finds distinctly unwelcome.</blockquote></div>
