            <div class="definition">A soft, black, crystalline form of carbon that conducts electricity and is used as a lubricant and as a moderator in nuclear reactors, as well as for making pencils.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous <b>graphite</b> anode cooled by a transpiring gas (Argon).</blockquote><blockquote>The anode material was porous <b>graphite</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The anode consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous <b>graphite</b> plug, 1/4 inch long.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>graphite</b> was National Carbon NC 60, which has a porosity of 50 % and an average pore size of 30 This small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving the anode.</blockquote><blockquote>The lower limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous <b>graphite</b> plug and that it became highly unstable.</blockquote></div>
