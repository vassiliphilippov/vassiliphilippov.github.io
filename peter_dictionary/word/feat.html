            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Both, of course, were remarkable <b>feats</b> and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime.</blockquote><blockquote>Only Bucky Harris, the "boy manager "of Washington in 1924, and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the <b>feat</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>They were further stripped of old wives' tales by seeing the slender, lovely Russian girls performing <b>feats</b> requiring tremendous strength - and with not one bulging muscle.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, to move (as the score requires) from the lowest F major register up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds, not skipping, at the same time, even one of the 407 fingerings, seems a <b>feat</b> too absurd to consider, and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical <b>feat</b>, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies; choruses, chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings; broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences.</blockquote></div>
