            <div class="definition">An area of land measured in acres; a tract or expanse of land, especially one used for farming or development.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote><b>Acreage</b> in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones.</blockquote><blockquote>Subways improved land values without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less (because the garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot), and reduce the <b>acreage</b> that can be taxed.</blockquote><blockquote>Sometimes a desired <b>acreage</b> is offered only as part of a larger tract.</blockquote><blockquote>When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an <b>acreage</b> that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm.</blockquote></div>
