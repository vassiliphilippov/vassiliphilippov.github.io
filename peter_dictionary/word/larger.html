            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Recent interferometer measurements (Radhakrishnan and Roberts, 1960) have shown the 960 - Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially polarized and to originate in a region of <b>larger</b> diameter than the visible disk.</blockquote><blockquote>In the observations at 4.3 mm (Coates, 1959 a), the diameter of the antenna beam, 6' .7, was small enough to allow resolution of some of the <b>larger</b> features of the lunar surface, and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phases.</blockquote><blockquote>A randomization of "ups "and "downs "is more likely than ordered "ups "and "downs "in position (3) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another, and also since ordered "up "and "down "implies a <b>larger</b> unit cell, for which no evidence exists.</blockquote><blockquote>Preliminary data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of * * f for masses <b>larger</b> than * * f for about 1000 events in a 22 - day period (LaGow and Alexander, 1960).</blockquote><blockquote>If one assumes that the average flux did not change between measurements, a mass distribution curve is obtained which relates the flux of particles <b>larger</b> than a given radius to the inverse 7 2 power of the radius.</blockquote></div>
