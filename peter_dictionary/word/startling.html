            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the <b>startling</b> statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote><blockquote>This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat <b>startling</b> notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath.</blockquote><blockquote>Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "<b>startling</b> experience which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when ".</blockquote><blockquote>I recall the <b>startling</b>, vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town.</blockquote><blockquote>Skeptics may deny the more <b>startling</b> phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed, but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence.</blockquote></div>
