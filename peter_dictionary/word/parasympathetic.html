            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Moreover, the dominance in <b>parasympathetic</b> action (with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic) at the hypothalamic level induces, by its peripheral action, the autonomic symptoms of sleep and, by its action on the cortex, a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system.</blockquote><blockquote>Although no drugs act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it, there is sufficient specificity to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a <b>parasympathetic</b> dominance.</blockquote><blockquote>Important as these differences are, they should not obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the <b>parasympathetic</b> side, we produce depressions, whereas a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and, eventually, maniclike changes.</blockquote><blockquote>A change in the balance to the <b>parasympathetic</b> side leads in the normal individual to sleep or, in special circumstances, to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomiting.</blockquote><blockquote>The fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states of <b>parasympathetic</b> (and also of sympathetic) dominance remain to be elucidated.</blockquote></div>
