            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The word "mimesis " ("imitation ") is usually associated with Plato and <b>Aristotle</b>.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Aristotle</b> also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and, like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.</blockquote><blockquote>But <b>Aristotle</b> kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths.</blockquote><blockquote>For both Plato and <b>Aristotle</b> artistic mimesis, in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality.</blockquote></div>
