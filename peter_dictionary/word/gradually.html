            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Baltimore's bulky spring training contingent now <b>gradually</b> will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit.</blockquote><blockquote>A century ago, Newman saw that liberalism (what we now might call secularism) would <b>gradually</b> but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism, and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a "serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own ".</blockquote><blockquote>This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared <b>gradually</b>, first, with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then, more firmly, with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions.</blockquote><blockquote>Even when the intensity of the shocks was increased <b>gradually</b>, it failed to evoke any signs of pain.</blockquote><blockquote>As the historic processes of modernization <b>gradually</b> gain momentum, their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces, the gaps between rulers and subjects, town and country, will widen; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction.</blockquote></div>
