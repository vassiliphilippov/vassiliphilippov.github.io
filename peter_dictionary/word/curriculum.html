            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>One or two of the schools have a five year <b>curriculum</b>, but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.</blockquote><blockquote>Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their <b>curriculum</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Beyond any question of <b>curriculum</b> and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves.</blockquote><blockquote>Nor is it an accident that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years, has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880's, or that courses in American literature, American civilization, American anything have swept our school and college <b>curricula</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal <b>curriculum</b>.</blockquote></div>
