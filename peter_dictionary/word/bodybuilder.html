            <div class="definition">A person who strengthens and enlarges their muscles through intensive exercise, often as a sport.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Too often a beginning <b>bodybuilder</b> has to do his training secretly either because his parents do n't want sonny-boy to "lift all those old barbell things "because "you 'll stunt your growth "or because childish taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey, lookit Mr. America, whaddya gonna do with all those muscles (of which he has none at the time) "?</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy <b>bodybuilder</b> who has never had to train in secret; has never heard one unkind word from his parents; and never has been taunted by his schoolmates!</blockquote><blockquote>As you see, the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the <b>bodybuilder</b> to use a wide grip.</blockquote><blockquote>But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise at all, because Henri de Courcy - the "happy "<b>bodybuilder</b> - looks as though he were having the time of his life!</blockquote><blockquote>Often these exercises work well for some <b>bodybuilders</b> but less spectacularly for others.</blockquote></div>
