            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In blind panic of grief she accepted Jonathan's dictum, and believed in her <b>desperation</b> that she had been cursed by God.</blockquote><blockquote>She could not resist the opportunity "of showing her superiority in argument over a man "which she had remarked as one of the "feminine follies "of Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness "to think of men as the privileged "and "women as submissive and yielding ", felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College - until once, in sheer <b>desperation</b>, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything.</blockquote></div>
