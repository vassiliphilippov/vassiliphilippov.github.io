            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>One growth center in a short bone - distal phalanx of the second finger - was chosen as an example for discussion here, primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion, the maturity indicator for Completion in long and short bones, occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable <b>pubescent</b> stage.</blockquote><blockquote>A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the <b>pubescent</b> stage.</blockquote><blockquote>Boys 32, 23, 31, 17, 30, 19, and 24 had "same schedule "at Onset and Completion; thus early forecasting of the <b>pubescent</b> stage would appear possible for only seven boys.</blockquote></div>
