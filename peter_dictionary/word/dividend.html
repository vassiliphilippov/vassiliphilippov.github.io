            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The line soon lived up to its name, as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal <b>dividends</b> on its capital stock.</blockquote><blockquote>Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli, e. g., quarterly and annual <b>dividend</b> reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The plan called for divestiture by du Pont of its 63000000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders, as a <b>dividend</b>, over a period of ten years.</blockquote><blockquote>The annual <b>dividends</b> paid to du Pont stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of du Pont's earnings and profits.</blockquote><blockquote>The measure, for federal income tax purposes, of the <b>dividend</b> to individual stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time of each annual distribution.</blockquote></div>
