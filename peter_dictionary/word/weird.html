            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that <b>weird</b> feeling as the deja vu (already seen) illusion, just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences.</blockquote><blockquote>Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including that <b>weird</b> feeling of deja vu, inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem.</blockquote><blockquote>The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or the vaguely, effective source of the <b>weird</b> deja vu feeling.</blockquote><blockquote>If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a <b>weird</b> feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past, he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vu.</blockquote><blockquote>The man uttered a <b>weird</b> cry, spun about, and collapsed in the sand.</blockquote></div>
