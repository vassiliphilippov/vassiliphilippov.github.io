            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>spire</b> seemed to hold up the sky.</blockquote><blockquote>Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown, beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop, and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and northward to Brooklyn, below Point Peter, he could see the church <b>spire</b> wherever he looked back.</blockquote><blockquote>The great <b>spire</b> shone as if the lightning had polished it.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus shielded, we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the fences became a part of the game - when a vine embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed <b>spire</b>, even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside.</blockquote></div>
