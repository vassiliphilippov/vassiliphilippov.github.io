            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Accordingly, it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation (which I shall call <b>mimesis</b> in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation) and a new theory of invention (which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter).</blockquote><blockquote>The word "<b>mimesis</b> " ("imitation ") is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle.</blockquote><blockquote>The Poetics, in affirming that all human arts are "modes of imitation ", gives a more serious role to artistic <b>mimesis</b> than did Plato.</blockquote><blockquote>For both Plato and Aristotle artistic <b>mimesis</b>, in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality.</blockquote><blockquote>Artistic <b>mimesis</b> under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama.</blockquote></div>
