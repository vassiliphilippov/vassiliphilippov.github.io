            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There is some evidence that naturally occurring <b>goitrogens</b> may play a role in the development of goitre, particularly in Tasmania and Australia (Clements and Wishart, 1956).</blockquote><blockquote>There it seems that the <b>goitrogen</b> ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active goitrogen, which is then secreted in the milk.</blockquote><blockquote>There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by dairy animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active <b>goitrogen</b>, which is then secreted in the milk.</blockquote><blockquote>Besides the presence of <b>goitrogens</b> in the diet, the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the thyroid gland.</blockquote></div>
