            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>At the least, however, one may conclude that Geometric <b>potters</b> sensed a logical order; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics and the hexameter line.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>potters</b> of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland, and in Greece itself Argive, Corinthian, Attic, Boeotian, and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks.</blockquote><blockquote>Many <b>potters</b> clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>potters</b>, in particular, had virtually eschewed freehand drawing, elaborate motifs, and the curving lines of nature, while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Ripe Geometric <b>potters</b> continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited.</blockquote></div>
