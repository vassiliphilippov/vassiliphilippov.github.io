            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In this connection, it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics, priests and <b>laity</b>, in England, while certainly seen as good for Catholicism, is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, not only are there considerably more <b>laity</b> as students and professors at Oxford, but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non Catholic members of the University.</blockquote><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and <b>laity</b> attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote></div>
