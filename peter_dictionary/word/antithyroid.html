            <div class="definition">(of a drug or agent) counteracting or inhibiting excessive activity of the thyroid gland.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote><b>Antithyroid</b> drugs are of two general types.</blockquote><blockquote>The other group of <b>antithyroid</b> agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, there are a few <b>antithyroid</b> drugs of this same general type, such as resorcinol, possessing no reducing activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular iodine.</blockquote><blockquote>Any of the <b>antithyroid</b> drugs, of either type, if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre, owing to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, with production of hypothyroidism.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>antithyroid</b> drugs of the thiouracil type, however, are not antagonised by such means.</blockquote></div>
