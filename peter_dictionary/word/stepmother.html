            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>stepmother</b>, almost without exception, has been presented as a cruel ogress.</blockquote><blockquote>Children, conditioned by this mistaken notion, have feared <b>stepmothers</b>, while adults, by their antagonistic attitudes, have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one.</blockquote><blockquote>Research, on the other hand, has shown many <b>stepmothers</b> to be eminently successful, some far better than the real mothers.</blockquote><blockquote>Helen Deutsch informed us (The Psychology of Women, Vol. 2,, 434) that in all cultures "the term' <b>stepmother</b>' automatically evokes deprecatory implications ", a conclusion accepted by many.</blockquote></div>
