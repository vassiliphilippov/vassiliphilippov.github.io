            <div class="definition">The act of selling off assets, subsidiaries, or shares, especially as ordered by a court to prevent monopolies or eliminate conflicts of interest.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The Government, deeming these suggestions inadequate, had urged that any judgment include <b>divestiture</b> of du Pont's shares of General Motors.</blockquote><blockquote>The submission of detailed plans would place the issues before the court more readily than would discussion of <b>divestiture</b> or disenfranchisement in the abstract.</blockquote><blockquote>The plan called for <b>divestiture</b> by du Pont of its 63000000 shares of General Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders, as a dividend, over a period of ten years.</blockquote><blockquote>It argued, inter alia, that a <b>divestiture</b> order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both General Motors and du Pont, with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investors, among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions; that there would be a similar decline in the market values of other automotive and chemical stocks, with similar losses to the stockholders of those companies; that the tremendous volume of General Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise equity capital; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity.</blockquote></div>
