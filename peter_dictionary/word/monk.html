Bluthenzweig; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>monk</b> who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception: "I speak English ", the old man said, "but I do not hear it very well ".</blockquote><blockquote>Smiling at Warren's protestations, the old <b>monk</b> took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor.</blockquote><blockquote>What does a <b>monk</b> know about sex "?</blockquote><blockquote>The Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist <b>monks</b>, strode rapidly among the houses, joked with the local soldiery, and made a speech.</blockquote></div>
