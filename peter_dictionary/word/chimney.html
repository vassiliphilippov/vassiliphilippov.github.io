            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Beyond that misty gray of the rain, he saw the stretching hutment, low diminutive log cabins, chinked with mud, with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through, with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes, or fence rails, with cranky <b>chimneys</b> of sticks and dried mud.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>chimney</b> of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out.</blockquote><blockquote>The smoke from that <b>chimney</b> rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other, and hung as sadly in the drizzle, creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof.</blockquote><blockquote>"We found some owls had built a nest in the <b>chimney</b>, milord, but I promise you you 'll never have trouble of that sort again ".</blockquote><blockquote>In the Steiners have busy lives without visiting relatives only context can indicate whether visiting relatives is equivalent in meaning to paying visits to relatives or to relatives who are visiting them, and in I looked up the number and I looked up the <b>chimney</b> only the meanings of number and chimney make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed by its object in the second.</blockquote></div>
