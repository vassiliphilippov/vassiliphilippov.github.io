W. Mills warned that he would <b>vigorously</b> prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone.</blockquote><blockquote>She could not resist the opportunity "of showing her superiority in argument over a man "which she had remarked as one of the "feminine follies "of Sara Sullam; and in her forthright way, Henrietta, who in her story of Sara had indicated her own unwillingness "to think of men as the privileged "and "women as submissive and yielding ", felt obliged to defend <b>vigorously</b> any statement of hers to which Morris Jastrow took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand on the Corbin affair, as well as on the radical reforms of Dr. Wise of Hebrew Union College - until once, in sheer desperation, he wrote that he had given up hope they would ever agree on anything.</blockquote><blockquote>The union <b>vigorously</b> demands wage increases from productivity increases, and wage increases to offset cost-of-living increases, but we abstract from these forces here.</blockquote><blockquote>For internal political reasons, the union asks for (and accepts) increases in the basic wage rate, and would <b>vigorously</b> oppose a reduction in this rate, but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry.</blockquote></div>
