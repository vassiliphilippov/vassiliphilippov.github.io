            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Your competition is now <b>proportionately</b> greater - you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products.</blockquote><blockquote>(We abstract here from technological progress and assume that prices of all other products change <b>proportionately</b>.)</blockquote><blockquote>The entry limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition, but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase <b>proportionately</b> throughout the economy, we might expect the public limit price to approach the entry limit price.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies, larger wage increases call for less than <b>proportionately</b> larger price increases (e. g., if a wage increase of 5 % allows a price increase of 7 %, a wage increase of 10 % allows a price increase of something less than 14 %).</blockquote></div>
