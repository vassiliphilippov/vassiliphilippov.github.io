Thomas published Basic Vocabulary in some Mon Khmer Languages AL 2, no. 3, pp. 7 - 11), which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages with the I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised retention rate (* * f) in place of original (* * f), and his revised 100 word basic <b>glottochronological</b> list in Towards Greater Accuracy (IJAL 21: 121 - 137).</blockquote><blockquote>These findings, and others which will in time be developed, will affect the method of <b>glottochronological</b> inquiry.</blockquote></div>
