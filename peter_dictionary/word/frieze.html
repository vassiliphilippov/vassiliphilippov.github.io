            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Wavy lines, feather like patterns, rosettes of indefinitely floral nature, birds either singly or in stylized rows, animals in solemn <b>frieze</b> bands (see Plates 11 - 12) - all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze.</blockquote><blockquote>The rows of animals and birds, in particular, suggest awareness of Oriental animal <b>friezes</b>, transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls and textiles, but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless Greek.</blockquote></div>
