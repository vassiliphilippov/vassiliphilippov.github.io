F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>The sections were fixed in <b>acetone</b> for 15 minutes and dried at 37 ` for 30 minutes.</blockquote><blockquote>After drying the sections under the fan, fixing in <b>acetone</b>, and drying at 37 ` as in the indirect method, the sections were treated with conjugated * * f or * * f (undiluted unless mentioned otherwise) for 5 - 30 minutes.</blockquote></div>
