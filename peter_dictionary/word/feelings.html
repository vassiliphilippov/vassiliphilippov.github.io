            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest <b>feelings</b> in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers.</blockquote><blockquote>As Yinger has pointed out, the "reliance on symbols, on tradition, on sacred writings, on the cultivation of emotional <b>feelings</b> of identity and harmony with sacred values, turns one to the past far more than to the future ".</blockquote><blockquote>And the thing about hurt <b>feelings</b>, the wet bathing suit pointed out, is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be.</blockquote><blockquote>As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and <b>feelings</b>, he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble, Arkansas, where no one had ever seen a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor, "The Big Bear of Arkansas ", in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature.</blockquote></div>
