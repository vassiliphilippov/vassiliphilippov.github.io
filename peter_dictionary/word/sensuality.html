            <div class="definition">The quality of being devoted to or preoccupied with the gratification of the senses or appetites, especially sexual pleasure.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The wife, Amra, and her lover are both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate <b>sensuality</b>, "voluptuous "and "indolent ", possibly "a mischief maker ", with "a kind of luxurious cunning "to set against her apparent simplicity, her "bird like brain ".</blockquote><blockquote>The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless <b>sensuality</b> and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem of suffering "); the miraculous way in which music, revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.</blockquote></div>
