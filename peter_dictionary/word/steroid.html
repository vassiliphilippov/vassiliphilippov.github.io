            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication of <b>steroid</b> therapy, with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use.</blockquote><blockquote>Although biopsies have shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of <b>steroid</b> induced weakness, this case provides the only example known to us in which necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle groups.</blockquote><blockquote>The case described in this paper is that of an older man who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of <b>steroids</b> for a refractory anemia.</blockquote><blockquote>Repeated attempts to withdraw <b>steroids</b> entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted, as well as fever, malaise, anorexia, anxiety, and an exacerbation of the anemia.</blockquote></div>
