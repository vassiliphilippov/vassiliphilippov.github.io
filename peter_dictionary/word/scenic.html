            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Naturally, a park site with <b>scenic</b> views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes, will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes.</blockquote><blockquote>Some recreation features, such as <b>scenic</b> values and water interest, also have greater overall value than other interests.</blockquote><blockquote>This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake provides <b>scenic</b> values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water sports.</blockquote><blockquote>However, a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include <b>scenic</b> strips within the park unit.</blockquote><blockquote>Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star: "The area in which Miss N - was injured is spectacularly <b>scenic</b> ".</blockquote></div>
