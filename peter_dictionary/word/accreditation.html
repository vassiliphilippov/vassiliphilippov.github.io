            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>For proper <b>accreditation</b> of schools, teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.</blockquote><blockquote>This brings us to the question of <b>accreditation</b> of art schools in general.</blockquote><blockquote>Only the independent art schools, that is, those not connected with any university or college, receive severe and separate investigation before <b>accreditation</b> by the various regional organizations.</blockquote><blockquote>It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of <b>accreditation</b> for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department.</blockquote><blockquote>There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools, whether independent or attached to universities have separate <b>accreditation</b> - as do medical schools - by an art accreditation group such as the "National Association of Schools of Art ".</blockquote></div>
