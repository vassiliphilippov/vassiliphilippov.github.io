Porter.</blockquote><blockquote>Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for he went far beyond the vital finding of <b>fiction</b> for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained since, even in the most inept hands.</blockquote></div>
