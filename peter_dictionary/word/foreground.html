            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes: a <b>foreground</b> in sharp focus - either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the major motif; and a background, usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky.</blockquote><blockquote>In following this general principle, Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from <b>foreground</b> to background, and the illusion of depth is instantly created.</blockquote></div>
