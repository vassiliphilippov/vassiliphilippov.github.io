            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>O'Connor and Eckenfelder discussed the use of <b>aerated</b> lagoons for treating organic wastes.</blockquote><blockquote>They indicated that a 4 - day retention, <b>aerated</b> lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent BOD reduction.</blockquote><blockquote>It appeared from the limited information available that the <b>aerated</b> lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume.</blockquote><blockquote>It was proposed that <b>aerated</b> lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development.</blockquote><blockquote>The lack of adequate data on the <b>aerated</b> lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage.</blockquote></div>
