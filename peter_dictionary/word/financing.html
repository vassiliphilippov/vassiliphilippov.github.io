            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>SBA makes loans to individual small business firms, providing them with <b>financing</b> when it is not otherwise available through private lending sources on reasonable terms.</blockquote><blockquote>SBA loans, which may be made to small manufacturers, small business pools, wholesalers, retailers, service establishments and other small businesses (when <b>financing</b> is not otherwise available to them on reasonable terms), are to finance business construction, conversion, or expansion; the purchase of equipment, facilities, machinery, supplies, or materials; or to supply working capital.</blockquote><blockquote>Evidence that other sources of <b>financing</b> are unavailable must be provided.</blockquote><blockquote>Recognizing the limitations of such a program, the 78 th Congress in 1943 passed P. L. 113, which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities, and which revised the <b>financing</b> structure.</blockquote><blockquote>The 1954 Amendments completely changed the <b>financing</b> of the vocational rehabilitation program, providing for a three part grant structure - for (1) basic support; (2) extension and improvement; and (3) research, demonstrations, training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation - and in addition for short-term training and instruction.</blockquote></div>
