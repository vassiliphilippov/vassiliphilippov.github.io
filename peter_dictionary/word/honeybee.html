            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Apart from the <b>honeybee</b>, practically all bees and bumblebees hibernate in a state of torpor.</blockquote><blockquote>The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble: <b>honeybees</b>, bumblebees, and other wild bees, and also various kinds of flies.</blockquote><blockquote>Quite often, <b>honeybees</b> form a majority on the willow catkins.</blockquote><blockquote>As we have already seen in the first chapter, bumblebees are bigger, hairier, and much more colorful than <b>honeybees</b>, exhibiting various combinations of black, yellow, white and orange.</blockquote><blockquote>It is almost certain that some of these, usually a trifle smaller than the <b>honeybees</b>, are andrenas or mining bees.</blockquote></div>
