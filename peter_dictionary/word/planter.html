            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Early in the war it was not uncommon for <b>planters</b>' sons to retain in camp Negro "body servants "to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging, cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>planter</b> aristocracy has appeared in literature at least since John Pendleton Kennedy published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait of Frank Meriwether presiding over his plantation dominion initiated the most persistent tradition of Southern literature.</blockquote><blockquote>The thoroughgoing idealization of the <b>planter</b> society did not come, however, until after the Civil War when Southern writers were eager to defend a way of life which had been destroyed.</blockquote><blockquote>Although Faulkner was the heir in his own family to this tradition, he did not have Stark Young's inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the <b>planter</b> society.</blockquote><blockquote>Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris and the Compson families Faulkner's chief concern is social criticism, we can say nevertheless that through those families he dramatizes his comment on the <b>planter</b> dynasties as they have existed since the decades before the Civil War.</blockquote></div>
