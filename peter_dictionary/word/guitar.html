            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Some time in 1912, Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a <b>guitar</b>; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings, thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane.</blockquote><blockquote>For Rachel, conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold girls - and she did make a pretty picture sitting in the grape-arbor strumming her <b>guitar</b> and singing in her silvery tones - there was no particular March counterpart; but both groups were so closely knit that despite individual differences the family life in both cases was remarkably similar in atmosphere if not entirely in content - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian.</blockquote><blockquote>The wailing, <b>guitar</b> strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him.</blockquote></div>
