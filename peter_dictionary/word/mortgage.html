            <div class="definition">a legal agreement by which a bank, building society, or similar organization lends money to a person to buy property, and the property is held as security for the loan until it is paid off</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the U. S. government; householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high interest <b>mortgages</b> found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent, under government aegis.</blockquote><blockquote>The bank which held the <b>mortgage</b> on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears, and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in, and that none would be sold to colored folk.</blockquote><blockquote>When it was proposed to rebuild the church, Wilson found that the terms for a new <b>mortgage</b> were very high.</blockquote><blockquote>If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free of <b>mortgage</b>, there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of.</blockquote></div>
