            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote><b>Morphophonemic</b> rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system.</blockquote><blockquote>Phonemes connected by a <b>morphophonemic</b> rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity, possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system.</blockquote><blockquote>The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology is an inverse function of the size - smaller systems are more troublesome - for any given degree of <b>morphophonemic</b> complexity.</blockquote><blockquote>And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base, the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at least, the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through <b>morphophonemic</b> rules to grammatically meaningful structures.</blockquote></div>
