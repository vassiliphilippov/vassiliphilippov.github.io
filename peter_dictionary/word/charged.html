            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Obviously, if colloidal particles bear charges of opposite sign or, if one kind is <b>charged</b> and the other kind is not, the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced.</blockquote><blockquote>Likewise, a <b>charged</b> particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa, and a charged particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge.</blockquote><blockquote>Likewise, a charged particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa, and a <b>charged</b> particle will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite charge.</blockquote><blockquote>This is particularly true of highly <b>charged</b> ions, especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes.</blockquote><blockquote>Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly sorbed at oil-water interfaces, the highly <b>charged</b> ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure (see Table 26 - 2 on p. 1678).</blockquote></div>
