            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It would be profitable, I believe, to read these realistic <b>humorists</b> alongside Faulkner's works, the thought being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly, but rather that they dealt a hundred years ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continued down to our time, to Faulkner's time.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the early <b>humorists</b> already mentioned, Thomas Bangs Thorpe, can be used to illustrate another point where Faulkner touches authentic Southern materials and also earlier literary treatment of those materials.</blockquote></div>
