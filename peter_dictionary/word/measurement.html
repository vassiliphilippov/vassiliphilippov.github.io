            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity, although the spectrum indicated by <b>measurements</b> at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600 ` K.</blockquote><blockquote>They deduced from their <b>measurements</b> that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission as measured by Pettit and Nicholson (1930) and Pettit (1935); and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3 - 1 2 days after Full Moon, which is again in contrast to the infrared emission, which reaches its maximum at Full Moon.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Measurements</b> of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth.</blockquote><blockquote>There have been few <b>measurements</b> specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>measurements</b> made with the NRL 50 - foot reflector, which is altitude azimuth mounted, would have shown a systematic change with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized.</blockquote></div>
