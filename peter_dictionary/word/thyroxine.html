            <div class="definition">A hormone produced by the thyroid gland that regulates metabolism by controlling the rate of oxidation in cells.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The mono - and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and <b>thyroxine</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids <b>thyroxine</b> and tri-iodothyronine (cf. Section C), it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion.</blockquote><blockquote>A study of their activity on thyroglobulin has shown that <b>thyroxine</b> is not preferentially released and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediates (Alpers, Petermann and Rall, 1956).</blockquote><blockquote>This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono - and di-iodotyrosine, but does not de-iodinate <b>thyroxine</b> or tri-iodothyronine.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>thyroxine</b> and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream.</blockquote></div>
