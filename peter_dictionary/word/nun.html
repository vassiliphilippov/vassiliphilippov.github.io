            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic <b>nun</b> had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote><blockquote>In particular he sought the gentle, sweet-faced <b>nuns</b>, with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads, remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper.</blockquote><blockquote>Especially touching is the chapter, "The Little Sister ", about a king's daughter who became a <b>nun</b> in the convent of St. Birgitta.</blockquote><blockquote>Would you like me better if I were a <b>nun</b>?</blockquote></div>
