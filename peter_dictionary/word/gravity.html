            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>We have ample light when the sun sets; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons; we fly through the air, although <b>gravity</b> pulls us down; the range of our voice ignores distance.</blockquote><blockquote>The greater the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave; Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to <b>gravity</b>.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>the more remote the body the less the gravity</blockquote><blockquote>the gravitation between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them</blockquote><blockquote>gravitation cannot be held responsible for people falling in love</blockquote></div>
