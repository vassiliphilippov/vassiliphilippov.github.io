Lee represented the <b>dignity</b> needed by a rebelling confederacy.</blockquote><blockquote>Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated with <b>dignity</b>, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up, disguised - that is, paradoxically, revealed - as a child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child.</blockquote><blockquote>The Providence Daily Journal, however, stated that Brown's courage, bravery, and heroism "in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives something of <b>dignity</b> even to a bad one ".</blockquote></div>
