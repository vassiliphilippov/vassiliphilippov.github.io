N.'s mission by initiating small "wars "with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under Albert Kalonji, wanted to <b>secede</b> as well.</blockquote><blockquote>To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states, who therefore retained the right to <b>secede</b> from it.</blockquote><blockquote>The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right to <b>secede</b>, though the citizens could.</blockquote><blockquote>In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to <b>secede</b>.</blockquote></div>
