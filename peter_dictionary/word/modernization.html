            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>As the historic processes of <b>modernization</b> gradually gain momentum, their cohesion will be threatened by divisive forces, the gaps between rulers and subjects, town and country, will widen; new aspirants for power will emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may lose their nerve and their sense of direction.</blockquote><blockquote>The men in power are committed in principle to <b>modernization</b>, but economic and social changes are proceeding only erratically.</blockquote><blockquote>Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions to effective action among those in power and by a failure on their part to understand how local resources, human and material, can be mobilized to achieve the national goals of <b>modernization</b> already symbolically accepted.</blockquote><blockquote>If <b>modernization</b> programs are imposed from above, without the understanding and cooperation of the people, they will encounter grave difficulties.</blockquote><blockquote>It should be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic growth and <b>modernization</b> of the society.</blockquote></div>
