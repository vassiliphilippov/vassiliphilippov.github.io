            <div class="definition">A public performance of music by musicians or singers, typically without theatrical staging.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>concert</b> opened with another big romantic score, Schumann's Overture to Manfred, which suffered fate, this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat.</blockquote><blockquote>She has since turned to Bellini, whose opera "Beatrice di Tenda "in a <b>concert</b> version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season.</blockquote><blockquote>The drama in the theater and the <b>concert</b> in the hall both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore, to much variation, as record collectors well know.</blockquote><blockquote>These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social economic haute monde which supported the <b>concert</b> world of the post World War 1, era.</blockquote><blockquote>The Americanegro Suite is in a sense an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection of Negro songs, not for a night club, but for the <b>concert</b> stage.</blockquote></div>
