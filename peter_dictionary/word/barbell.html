            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents do n't want sonny-boy to "lift all those old <b>barbell</b> things "because "you 'll stunt your growth "or because childish taunts from his schoolmates, like "Hey, lookit Mr. America, whaddya gonna do with all those muscles (of which he has none at the time) "?</blockquote><blockquote>The "push "exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the <b>barbell</b> variation.</blockquote><blockquote>You need the <b>barbell</b> variation to build width and mass in the pecs.</blockquote><blockquote>Place a suitably loaded <b>barbell</b> across them; grasp the bar (which will rest against the back of your neck); extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split.</blockquote><blockquote>You should also begin this exercise with a very light <b>barbell</b> until you become accustomed to it balance wise.</blockquote></div>
