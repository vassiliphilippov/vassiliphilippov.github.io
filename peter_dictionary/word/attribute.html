J. D. Wickham, headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary, was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor, Samuel F. B. Morse.</blockquote><blockquote>Juanita drooped about the place, wearing a haunted, brooding look, which Kate <b>attributed</b> to the baby's death, until the day a letter came for her addressed to "Miss Juanita Fitzroy ", bearing a Grafton postmark.</blockquote><blockquote>These bunks also serve as a fence, so part of the additional cost must be <b>attributed</b> to the fence.</blockquote></div>
