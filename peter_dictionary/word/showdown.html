            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In a sense, the <b>showdown</b> promised by Mr. Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided; no precedents have been set as yet; structurally, the U.N. is still fluid, vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it.</blockquote><blockquote>Fearful of inviting a military <b>showdown</b> with the West which they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level.</blockquote></div>
