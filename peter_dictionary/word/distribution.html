Model 95) served for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature <b>distribution</b> along the anode holder.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, the dotted line shown in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature <b>distribution</b> for all blowing rates.</blockquote></div>
