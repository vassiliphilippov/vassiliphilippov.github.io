            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and <b>interdependent</b> processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail, is initially given in the way man feels the world.</blockquote><blockquote>Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely <b>interdependent</b>, as they are each a part of the whole.</blockquote><blockquote>It is as large as all of art, <b>interdependent</b>, varied, multitudinous ".</blockquote></div>
