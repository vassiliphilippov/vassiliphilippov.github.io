            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler <b>lawyer</b> representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.</blockquote><blockquote>The 53 - year old Shea, a prominent corporation <b>lawyer</b> with a sports background, is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York.</blockquote><blockquote>He was the <b>lawyer</b> for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League.</blockquote><blockquote>Professionally a <b>lawyer</b>, that is to say associated with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up, disguised - that is, paradoxically, revealed - as a child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child.</blockquote><blockquote>This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon <b>lawyers</b> and theologians in the Middle Ages; and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.</blockquote></div>
