Marvin Griffin.</blockquote><blockquote>The Highway Department source told The Constitution, however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural <b>roads</b> bonds.</blockquote><blockquote>Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing <b>roads</b> and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land.</blockquote><blockquote>For instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national forest or a public <b>road</b>, may be desirable, whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not.</blockquote></div>
