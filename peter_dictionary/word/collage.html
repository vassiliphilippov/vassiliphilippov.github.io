            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Picasso says that he himself had already made his first <b>collage</b> toward the end of 1911, when he glued a piece of imitation caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas.</blockquote><blockquote>It is true that his first <b>collage</b> looks more Analytical than Braque's, which would confirm the date he assigns it.</blockquote><blockquote>When we examine what each master says was his first <b>collage</b> we see that much the same thing happens in each.</blockquote><blockquote>(It makes no real difference that Braque's <b>collage</b> is on paper and eked out in charcoal, while Picasso's is on canvas and eked out in oil.)</blockquote><blockquote>In their very first <b>collages</b>, Braque and Picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth, so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real, bas-relief space - or to be about to do so - while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in, or flat upon, the surface.</blockquote></div>
