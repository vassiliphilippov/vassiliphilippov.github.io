            <div class="definition">A measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution, defined as the logarithm of the reciprocal of hydrogen ion concentration on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic), with 7 being neutral.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Fahey and Morrison used a single, continuous gradient at constant <b>pH</b> for the fractionation of anti - A and anti - B agglutinins from preisolated | g-globulin samples.</blockquote><blockquote>This buffer, <b>pH</b> 8.6, was 0.005 M in * * f and 0.039 M in tris (hydroxymethyl) - aminomethane (Tris).</blockquote><blockquote>Each initially contained 1700 ml of buffer; in the sphere was starting buffer and in the cone was final buffer, 0.50 M in both * * f and Tris, <b>pH</b> 4.1.</blockquote><blockquote>Paper electrophoresis was carried out on the concentrated samples in a Spinco model R cell using barbital buffer, <b>pH</b> 8.6, ionic strength 0.075, at room temperature on Whatman 3 MM filter paper.</blockquote><blockquote>Fractions from the column which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation were concentrated by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volumes of phosphate buffered saline, <b>pH</b> 7.2, ionic strength 0.154.</blockquote></div>
