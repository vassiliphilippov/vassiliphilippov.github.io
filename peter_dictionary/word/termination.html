            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment, for some <b>termination</b> seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand, Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural <b>termination</b> of temporal existence.</blockquote><blockquote>If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural <b>termination</b>, the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator.</blockquote></div>
