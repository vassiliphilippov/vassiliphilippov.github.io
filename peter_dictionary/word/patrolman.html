T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six "- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses "- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered.</blockquote></div>
