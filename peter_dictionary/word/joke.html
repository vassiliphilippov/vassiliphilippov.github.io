            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>His addle-brained knight-errant, self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a <b>joke</b>, is, as Cervantes no doubt intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.</blockquote><blockquote>The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the <b>joke</b> gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem of suffering "); the miraculous way in which music, revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, to find a learned diversion and a pleasing <b>joke</b> in More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars, of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed, of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself.</blockquote><blockquote>This <b>joke</b> was not funny to Linda Kay, and she blushed, as she always did; then, hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter, blushed redder.</blockquote><blockquote>We now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror <b>jokes</b>, magazines known as Horror Comics, and sick comedians.</blockquote></div>
