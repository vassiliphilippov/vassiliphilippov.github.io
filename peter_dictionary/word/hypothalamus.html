            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on individual experience and are aroused in man, in addition, by complex symbols, one would expect that the <b>hypothalamus</b> could be excited from the cortex.</blockquote><blockquote>In experiments with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex, the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the <b>hypothalamus</b> was demonstrated.</blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, the responsiveness of the <b>hypothalamus</b> to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these conditions.</blockquote><blockquote>But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals such as the rat, sex activity closely identified with the <b>hypothalamus</b> and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex.</blockquote><blockquote>MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species, as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain (including the <b>hypothalamus</b>) on emotions related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions.</blockquote></div>
