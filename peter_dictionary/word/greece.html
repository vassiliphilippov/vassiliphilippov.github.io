            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>While Protogeometric vases usually turn up, especially outside <b>Greece</b> proper, together with as many or more examples of local stamp, these "non Greek "patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century.</blockquote><blockquote>The potters of the Aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland, and in <b>Greece</b> itself Argive, Corinthian, Attic, Boeotian, and other Geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks.</blockquote><blockquote>Figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in <b>Greece</b>; objects in gold, ivory, and bronze grow more numerous.</blockquote><blockquote>We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the East as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery, the epic and the myth, and the religious evolution of early <b>Greece</b>; the important point, however, is that these magnificent achievements, unlike those of later decades, were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models.</blockquote><blockquote>Being somewhat delicate in health, at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad, at first in Italy, then in <b>Greece</b>, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Palestine.</blockquote></div>
