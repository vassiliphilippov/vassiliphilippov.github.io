            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The blooms of Ribes and of the willow and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early <b>insects</b> will assemble: honeybees, bumblebees, and other wild bees, and also various kinds of flies.</blockquote><blockquote>In the United States Department of Agriculture's Yearbook of Agriculture, 1952, which is devoted entirely to <b>insects</b>, George E. Bohart mentions a site in Utah which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females.</blockquote><blockquote>Drought, hail, disease, and <b>insects</b> take their toll of crops.</blockquote><blockquote>Out of the church and into his big car, it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college, his expansiveness, the quaint little pine board tourist courts, cabins really, with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling (unfrosted and naked as a streetlight, like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid, where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs, watching in between your bouts at hopscotch), a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls, an <b>insect</b> Highway Patrol with feelers waving.</blockquote></div>
