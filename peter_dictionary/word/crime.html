Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these <b>crimes</b> or carrying arms - he just did n't catch anyone.</blockquote><blockquote>For these <b>crimes</b> he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday, December 2, 1859.</blockquote><blockquote>But it had, as was usual in southern cities of this sort, a Black Bottom, a low region near the river where the Negroes lived - servants and laborers huddled together in a region with no sewage save the river, where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and <b>crime</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>How could the rich, for whom life was made so simple, ever understand the subterfuges, the lies, the frauds, the errors, sins and even <b>crimes</b> to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life?</blockquote><blockquote>They possessed no outer fortifications, no hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day, let alone having an awful <b>crime</b> thrust upon them.</blockquote></div>
