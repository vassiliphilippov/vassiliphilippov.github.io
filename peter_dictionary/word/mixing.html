            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum <b>mixing</b> of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents.</blockquote><blockquote>The long retention period and the complete <b>mixing</b> concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent.</blockquote><blockquote>The slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the <b>mixing</b> of the raw sewage.</blockquote><blockquote>Variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased <b>mixing</b> and increased oxygen demand.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>paste made by a mix of flour and water</blockquote><blockquote>the mixing of sound channels in the recording studio</blockquote></div>
