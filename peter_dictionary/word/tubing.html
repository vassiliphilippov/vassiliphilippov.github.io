            <div class="definition">A long, hollow cylinder, usually made of metal, plastic, or glass, used for conveying liquids, gases, or other materials.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In a few experiments the tubes were made from standard 6 mm. i.d. Pyrex <b>tubing</b> of 1 mm. wall thickness.</blockquote><blockquote>The photochemical reaction cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex <b>tubing</b>, 5.5 cm. long, diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid glass interfaces and not gas glass interfaces.</blockquote><blockquote>These cells were used rather than square Pyrex <b>tubing</b> because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride.</blockquote><blockquote>Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer whose <b>tubing</b> is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.</blockquote></div>
