            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished, so most <b>notably</b> in the statement: "If the [ Holy ] Spirit is absent from the soul, such a man is indeed of an animal nature; and, being left carnal, he will be an imperfect being, possessing the image [ of God ] in his formation, but not receiving the similitude [ of God ] through the Spirit ".</blockquote><blockquote>Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions, most <b>notably</b> the "Schnabel trill " (which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously).</blockquote><blockquote>Nevertheless, there are <b>notably</b> frequent instances of deja vu, in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which, though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists.</blockquote><blockquote>The strains of neutralism are running strong, <b>notably</b> in England, and even in Germany.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, one hebephrenic man used to annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day, or whenever, "You 're welcome ", in a <b>notably</b> condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful, "thank you "to him at the end of each session.</blockquote></div>
