            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>We should expect that general <b>phonologic</b> theory should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels, but it has not been.</blockquote><blockquote>If, as I suspect, the problem is largely of the second sort, then development of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically in better theory for all <b>phonologic</b> subsystems.</blockquote><blockquote>One issue that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different <b>phonologic</b> subsystems.</blockquote><blockquote>Since tone systems typically comprise fewer units than either consonant or vowel systems, we might expect that they would be the easiest part of a <b>phonologic</b> analysis.</blockquote><blockquote>Other pairs of <b>phonologic</b> subsystems also interact or overlap in this way; for example, duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation.</blockquote></div>
