            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago style jazz in prime evening time, for example, could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous <b>documentary</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along <b>documentary</b> lines.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous <b>documentaries</b>, art films, and travelogues, despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the play, the novel, or the short story.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus such great American <b>documentaries</b> as The River and The Plow That Broke the Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.</blockquote><blockquote>Her impact in the ZING commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series, Underwater Western Eye, a <b>documentary</b> type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits.</blockquote></div>
