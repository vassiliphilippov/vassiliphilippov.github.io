            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The blooms of Ribes and of the <b>willow</b> and sloe are the places where large numbers of our early insects will assemble: honeybees, bumblebees, and other wild bees, and also various kinds of flies.</blockquote><blockquote>Each male <b>willow</b> catkin is composed of a large number of small flowers.</blockquote><blockquote>The staminate <b>willow</b> catkins, then, provide their visitors with both nectar and pollen; a marvelous arrangement, for it provides exactly what the bee queens need to make their beebread, a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species are fed.</blockquote><blockquote>Quite often, honeybees form a majority on the <b>willow</b> catkins.</blockquote><blockquote>But let us return, after this gruesome interlude, to our <b>willow</b> catkins in the spring; there are other wild bees that command our attention.</blockquote></div>
