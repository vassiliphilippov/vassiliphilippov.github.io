            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The "moving "picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same subject, but the difference is really one of degree; the <b>cinematic</b> element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo.</blockquote><blockquote>Time and space have both become <b>cinematic</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; these films and these sequences are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly <b>cinematic</b> elements of narrative.</blockquote></div>
