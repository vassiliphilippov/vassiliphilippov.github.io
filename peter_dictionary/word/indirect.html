F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>(3) In other experiments the <b>indirect</b> conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade (1957).</blockquote><blockquote>After drying the sections under the fan, fixing in acetone, and drying at 37 ` as in the <b>indirect</b> method, the sections were treated with conjugated * * f or * * f (undiluted unless mentioned otherwise) for 5 - 30 minutes.</blockquote><blockquote>This conjugate was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue powders in the same manner as described for the <b>indirect</b> method.</blockquote><blockquote>Results of specific staining by the direct and the <b>indirect</b> methods were similar and showed the localization of WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors.</blockquote></div>
