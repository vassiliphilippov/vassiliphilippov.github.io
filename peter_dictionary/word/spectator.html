            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The big, 22 - year old shortstop, the 1960 American league "rookie of the year ", flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated $ 15000 and was a <b>spectator</b> at tonight's 5 - to 3 loss to Kansas City - the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row.</blockquote><blockquote>Among the <b>spectators</b> was the noted exotic dancer, Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage.</blockquote><blockquote>A <b>spectator</b> picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.</blockquote><blockquote>Each scene is shot straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which had been, roughly, that of a <b>spectator</b> in a center orchestra seat at a play.</blockquote><blockquote>Mostly the scene was crowded with mourners, such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna, where the grief-stricken <b>spectators</b> had usurped Mary's last poignant moment.</blockquote></div>
