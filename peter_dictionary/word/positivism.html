            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Indeed, with developed <b>positivism</b>, the separation of law from justice, or from morality generally, became quite specific.</blockquote><blockquote>In municipal systems we tend to view what is called <b>positivism</b> as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliament - the elected representatives - at the expense of the more conservative judiciary.</blockquote><blockquote>The displacement (at least to a considerable extent) of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by <b>positivism</b> reshaped both international law theory and doctrine.</blockquote></div>
