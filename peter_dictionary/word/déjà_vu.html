            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the <b>deja vu</b> (already seen) illusion, just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences.</blockquote><blockquote>When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance of <b>deja vu</b>, except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar.</blockquote><blockquote>Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including that weird feeling of <b>deja vu</b>, inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem.</blockquote><blockquote>The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or the vaguely, effective source of the weird <b>deja vu</b> feeling.</blockquote><blockquote>Nevertheless, there are notably frequent instances of <b>deja vu</b>, in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which, though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists.</blockquote></div>
