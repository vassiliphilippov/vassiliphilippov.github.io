            <div class="definition">A hormone produced by the thyroid gland that contains three iodine atoms and plays a key role in regulating metabolism.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The mono - and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form <b>tri-iodothyronine</b> and thyroxine.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and <b>tri-iodothyronine</b> (cf. Section C), it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion.</blockquote><blockquote>This de-iodinating enzyme is effective against mono - and di-iodotyrosine, but does not de-iodinate thyroxine or <b>tri-iodothyronine</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The thyroxine and <b>tri-iodothyronine</b> released by proteolysis and so escaping de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream.</blockquote></div>
