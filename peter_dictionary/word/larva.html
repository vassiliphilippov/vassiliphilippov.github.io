            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>When the <b>larvae</b> hatch, they feed on the beebread, although they also receive extra honey meals from their mother.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>larvae</b>, kept warm by the queen, are full grown in about ten days.</blockquote><blockquote>By the middle of the summer, many of the <b>larvae</b> apparently receive such a good diet that it is "optimal ", and it is then that young queens begin to appear.</blockquote><blockquote>The nest itself, the structure that in some cases housed about 2000 individuals when the season was at its peak, is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging <b>larvae</b> of certain beetles and moths.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, the <b>larvae</b> of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread.</blockquote></div>
