            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote><b>Christ</b> is both unique and universal.</blockquote><blockquote>As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning, so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of <b>Christ</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too; for as it was <b>Christ</b>, the Word of God, who came to rescue man, so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world, and all our woe.</blockquote><blockquote>This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, as a parallel to the death of <b>Christ</b> on Good Friday; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath.</blockquote><blockquote>This idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in <b>Christ</b>.</blockquote></div>
