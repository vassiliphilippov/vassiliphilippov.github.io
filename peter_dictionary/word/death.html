Callan, shot himself to <b>death</b> March 18, four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.</blockquote><blockquote>But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its <b>death</b> in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong.</blockquote><blockquote>This idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through <b>death</b> to life that is achieved in Christ.</blockquote><blockquote>The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem of suffering "); the miraculous way in which music, revelation and <b>death</b> are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.</blockquote><blockquote>The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while the way to the churchyard belongs to <b>death</b>.</blockquote></div>
