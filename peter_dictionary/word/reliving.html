            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms, particularly in certain types of personality, but it is also known that the <b>reliving</b> of a strong emotion ("abreaction ") may cure a battle neurosis.</blockquote><blockquote>Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual <b>re-living</b> of experience, in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself.</blockquote><blockquote>I mean something more like Freud's concept of the utility of "play "to a small child: he plays "house "or "doctor "or "fireman "as a way of mastering slightly frightening experiences, <b>reliving</b> them imaginatively until they are under control.</blockquote></div>
