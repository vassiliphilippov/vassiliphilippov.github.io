            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Radio observations of Venus and <b>Jupiter</b> have already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions of these planets.</blockquote><blockquote>For the case of <b>Jupiter</b>, the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator, and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components.</blockquote><blockquote>The radio emission of a planet was first detected in 1955, when Burke and Franklin (1955) identified the origin of interference like radio noise on their records at about 15 meters wave length as emission from <b>Jupiter</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 cm, and from Mars and <b>Jupiter</b> at 3.15 cm in 1956 (Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958 a, b, c), and from Saturn at 3.75 cm in 1957 (Drake and Ewen, 1958).</blockquote><blockquote>In the relatively short time since these early observations, Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 0.8 to 10.2 cm, and <b>Jupiter</b> has been observed over the wave-length range from 3.03 to 68 cm.</blockquote></div>
