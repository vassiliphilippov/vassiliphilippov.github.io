Porter.</blockquote><blockquote>This <b>discovery</b> of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling, magician's tricks produced on film.</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed we should say, on the contrary, that the accident of our later <b>discovery</b> made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal's pain, that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not.</blockquote><blockquote>The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical <b>discovery</b>.</blockquote></div>
