F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>Two absorptions of * * f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of * * f (which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride), NS and * * f with crown gall tissue powder, or <b>mouse</b> liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining.</blockquote><blockquote>Treatment of the conjugates with ethyl acetate, and the conjugates (which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride) with <b>mouse</b> liver powder, sweet clover crown gall tissue powder, or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates.</blockquote><blockquote>In litters of eight <b>mice</b> from similar parents, the number of mice with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8.</blockquote><blockquote>In litters of eight mice from similar parents, the number of <b>mice</b> with straight instead of wavy hair is an integer from 0 to 8.</blockquote></div>
