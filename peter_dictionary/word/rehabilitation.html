L. 113, which broadened the concept of <b>rehabilitation</b> to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities, and which revised the financing structure.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite the successful <b>rehabilitation</b> of over a half million disabled persons in the first eleven years after 1943, the existing program was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million disabled.</blockquote><blockquote>These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized <b>rehabilitation</b> facilities, for more sheltered and "half-way "workshops, for greater numbers of adequately trained personnel, for more comprehensive services to individuals (particularly to the homebound and the blind), and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's overall effectiveness.</blockquote><blockquote>Under P. L. 113, 78 th Congress, the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled, and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with <b>rehabilitation</b> case services.</blockquote><blockquote>For the States which maintain two separate agencies - one for the vocational <b>rehabilitation</b> of the blind, and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the blind - the Act specifies that their minimum (base) allotment shall be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided in fiscal year 1954.</blockquote></div>
