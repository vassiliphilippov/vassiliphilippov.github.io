            <div class="definition">(in thermodynamics) A quantity equal to the total internal energy of a system plus the product of its pressure and volume, representing the total heat content.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Assuming thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpiring argon, the gas <b>enthalpy</b> rise through the anode was calculated according to the relation **f whereby the specific heat of argon was taken as **f.</blockquote><blockquote>This calculation results in an <b>enthalpy</b> rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.</blockquote></div>
