            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a <b>whore</b> dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack the problem of suffering "); the miraculous way in which music, revelation and death are associated in a single instant - all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.</blockquote><blockquote>Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up, disguised - that is, paradoxically, revealed - as a child, and, worse, as a <b>whore</b> masquerading as a child.</blockquote><blockquote>Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred - pimps, panders and <b>whores</b>.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Whores</b>!</blockquote></div>
