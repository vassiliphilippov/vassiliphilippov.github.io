M. A., and the Veterinary Journal, among other repositories of higher wisdom, and before much longer if you did n't have a cake of their soap in the john, even your best friends would think you did n't <b>bathe</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>It was also subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never <b>bathed</b>.</blockquote></div>
