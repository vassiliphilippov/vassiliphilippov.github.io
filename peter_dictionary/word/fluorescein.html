            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In attempting to improve specificity of staining, the <b>fluorescein</b> labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways: (1) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders (Coons, 1958) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (E. F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>Schramm and Rottger (1959) did not report any such nonspecific staining of plant tissues with <b>fluorescein</b> isocyanate labeled antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus.</blockquote></div>
