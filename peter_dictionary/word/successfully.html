Stephens, who has prosecuted many device quacks, "the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be <b>successfully</b> prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court ".</blockquote><blockquote>As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new "unnatural "and internally controlled environments to cope even more <b>successfully</b> with the entropy increasing properties of the external world.</blockquote></div>
