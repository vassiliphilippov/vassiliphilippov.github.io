Zimmerman was <b>reelected</b> for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, after 24 years in the Senate, Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene - having walked, swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 - left that august body (voluntarily, because he could surely have been <b>re-elected</b> had he chosen to run again last November), as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate.</blockquote></div>
