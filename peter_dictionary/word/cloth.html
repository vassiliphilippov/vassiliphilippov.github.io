            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>This is best demonstrated by practical washing tests in which <b>cloth</b> articles are repeatedly washed with the same detergent formulation.</blockquote><blockquote>In this way, numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations can be obtained by measuring the reflectance (whiteness) of the <b>cloth</b> swatches before and after washing.</blockquote><blockquote>Cleaned <b>cloth</b> must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil.</blockquote><blockquote>(1) When an object was placed in the patient's hand, he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold, sharp or blunt, rough or smooth, flexible, soft, or hard; and he could tell, simply by the feel of it, whether it was made of wood, iron, <b>cloth</b>, rubber, and so on.</blockquote><blockquote>By its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness, the affixed paper or <b>cloth</b> serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>the fabric in the curtains was light and semitransparent</blockquote><blockquote>woven cloth originated in Mesopotamia around 5000 BC</blockquote><blockquote>she measured off enough material for a dress</blockquote></div>
