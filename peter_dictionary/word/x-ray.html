            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In fact, the recent warnings about the use of <b>X-rays</b> have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding, and thus in this instance, science has momentarily aggravated our fears.</blockquote><blockquote>There is, then, the possibility that this <b>f bond is symmetric, although Douglass was unable to determine its symmetry from his </b>x-ray** data.</blockquote><blockquote><b>X-ray</b> and experimental density showed one formula unit in the unit cell, corresponding to a paramagnetic ion density of **f.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>x-ray</b> data did not permit Douglass to determine uniquely the space group, but a negative test for piezoelectricity led him to assume a center of symmetry.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>x-ray</b> data are consistent with particle sizes of 1000 A or greater.</blockquote></div>
