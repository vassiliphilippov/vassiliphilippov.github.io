            <div class="definition">A powerful light, usually with a reflector, attached to the front of a vehicle such as a car or locomotive to illuminate the road ahead.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>They were climbing the hill in the night when the <b>headlights</b> abruptly probed solid blackness, became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended.</blockquote><blockquote>Muller, nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's <b>headlights</b>, threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table; his face wore a look of outrage.</blockquote><blockquote>The police car had pulled up behind a small sedan, its <b>headlights</b> still on.</blockquote><blockquote>Out of the church and into his big car, it tooling over the road with him driving and the <b>headlights</b> sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college, his expansiveness, the quaint little pine board tourist courts, cabins really, with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling (unfrosted and naked as a streetlight, like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid, where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs, watching in between your bouts at hopscotch), a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls, an insect Highway Patrol with feelers waving.</blockquote><blockquote>So you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the <b>headlights</b>, waiting for you, for your new spectator pumps, waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt, crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off, because that is being an old maid too, if you happen to drive a car, it is changing the tire yourself in the night, and in the mud and the rain, hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help.</blockquote></div>
