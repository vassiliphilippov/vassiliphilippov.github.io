            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary <b>outreach</b> of the major denominations.</blockquote><blockquote>In a mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, the recruitment or missionary <b>outreach</b> of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation - like elements will have to be assimilated.</blockquote><blockquote>Evangelism and congregational <b>outreach</b> have not been carefully studied in the churches; one study in Pittsburgh, however, has illuminated the situation.</blockquote><blockquote>Missionary <b>outreach</b> by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations.</blockquote><blockquote>The identification of the basic unit of religious organization - the parish or congregation - with a residential area is self defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the <b>outreach</b> of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation.</blockquote></div>
