Ramsperger says, "passed on to the <b>brain</b>, and there, by some unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception ".</blockquote><blockquote>But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the <b>brain</b>?</blockquote><blockquote>As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the <b>brain</b> it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers - rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location.</blockquote></div>
