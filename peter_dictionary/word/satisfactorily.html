F. Whitcomb); but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1: 4 did not <b>satisfactorily</b> remove nonspecific staining.</blockquote><blockquote>Specific staining by DEAE-cellulose treated * * f and * * f, although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells, was not <b>satisfactorily</b> photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts with black and white and color photography.</blockquote></div>
