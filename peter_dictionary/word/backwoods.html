            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Simms admired the raucous tales emanating from the <b>backwoods</b>, but he had himself social affiliations which would not allow him to approve them fully.</blockquote><blockquote>Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, a preacher and a college and university president in four Southern states, published the earliest of these <b>backwoods</b> sketches and in the character Ransy Sniffle, in the accounts of sharp horse-trading and eye gouging physical combat, and in the shockingly unliterary speech of his characters, he set an example followed by many after him.</blockquote><blockquote>As a consequence of the tensions thus produced in his thoughts and feelings, he wrote on the one hand sketches of idealized hunting trips and on the other an anecdote of the village of Hardscrabble, Arkansas, where no one had ever seen a piano; and he wrote also the masterpiece of frontier humor, "The Big Bear of Arkansas ", in which earthy realism is placed alongside the exaggeration of the <b>backwoods</b> tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplates the grandeur and the mysteries of nature.</blockquote></div>
