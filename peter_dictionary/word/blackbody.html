            <div class="definition">A theoretical object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence, and emits radiation with a characteristic spectrum determined by its temperature.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The observed intensity of the radio emission of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity, although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a <b>black body</b> at about 600 ` K.</blockquote><blockquote>This result suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet, although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non thermal components and that the observed spectrum is that of a <b>black body</b> merely by coincidence.</blockquote><blockquote>For the case of Jupiter, the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a <b>black-body</b> radiator, and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components.</blockquote><blockquote>The concept of apparent <b>black-body</b> temperature is used to describe the radiation received from the moon and the planets.</blockquote><blockquote>The received radiation is compared with the radiation from a hypothetical <b>black-body</b> which subtends the same solid angle as the visible disk of the planet.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>a black body maintained at a constant temperature is a full radiator at that temperature because the radiation reaching and leaving it must be in equilibrium</blockquote></div>
