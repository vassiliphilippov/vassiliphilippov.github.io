            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote><b>Sonar</b> can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy.</blockquote><blockquote>A <b>sonar</b> or radar type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body tissue evaluation.</blockquote><blockquote>Our readers are familiar with the principles of <b>sonar</b> where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects.</blockquote><blockquote>In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the <b>sonar</b> beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.</blockquote><blockquote>In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in <b>sonar</b>.</blockquote></div>
