            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Some who have written on <b>Utopia</b> have treated it as "a learned diversion of a learned world ", "a phantasy with which More amused himself ", "a holiday work, a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits, a revel of debate, paradox, comedy and invention ".</blockquote><blockquote>First, it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page <b>Utopia</b> is described as "festivus ", "gay ".</blockquote><blockquote>It is doubtful that <b>Utopia</b> is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed, it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr.</blockquote><blockquote>It is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr - indeed, it is likely that these days many who read <b>Utopia</b> with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Utopia</b> is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity.</blockquote></div>
