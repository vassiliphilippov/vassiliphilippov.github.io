            <div class="definition">A large, powerful sea wave caused by an underwater earthquake, volcanic eruption, or landslide, often causing great destruction when it reaches land.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>A <b>tsunami</b> may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake or a volcanic eruption.</blockquote><blockquote>Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great <b>tsunami</b> of ancient times.</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, a tremendously destructive <b>tsunami</b> that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the most damaging <b>tsunami</b> on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Tsunami</b> are rare, however, in the Atlantic Ocean; they are far more common in the Pacific.</blockquote></div>
