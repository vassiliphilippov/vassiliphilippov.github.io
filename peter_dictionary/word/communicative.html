            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a <b>communicative</b> network basis.</blockquote><blockquote>Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated, or reduced, in their <b>communicative</b> expression, to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement.</blockquote><blockquote>To a much less full extent, the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus has a comparable <b>communicative</b> function; in working with these patients the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning of a belch, or the passage of flatus, not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze, but also because he learns that even these animal like sounds constitute forms of communication in which, from time to time, quite different things are being said, long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these, as distinct feelings and concepts, to say them in words.</blockquote></div>
