            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In the Analytical phase of their Cubism, Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize <b>three-dimensionality</b> simply in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it - to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself.</blockquote><blockquote>It was as though, in that instant, he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back - or forward - to literal <b>three-dimensionality</b>.</blockquote></div>

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p class="etymology-body">From 'three-dimensional' + suffix '-ity'. 'Three' from Old English 'thrīe', 'dimensional' from Latin 'dimensio' (a measuring); '-ity' from Latin '-itas' indicating a state or condition.</p>
