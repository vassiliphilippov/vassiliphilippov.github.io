S. Steel's Pittsburgh works - often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city, yet close to transport (river), storage (piers) and power (river).</blockquote><blockquote>One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin <b>rubber</b> tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched.</blockquote><blockquote>Mike Deegan pounded the <b>rubber</b> plate with the end of his bat.</blockquote></div>
