            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous "moon "bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide grip Straight-Arm Pullover (the "pull "part of the Push-Pull Super-Set) which dramatically widens the rib cage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest, and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide, Reeves-type "gladiator "pecs, while stimulating the upper <b>lats</b> and frontal deltoids.</blockquote><blockquote>(Note how strongly the upper <b>lats</b> and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords).</blockquote><blockquote>By this time Henri's entire chest back - <b>lat</b> shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral front deltoid shaping work.</blockquote><blockquote>This gives a wide flare to the pecs, causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and <b>lats</b>.</blockquote></div>
