            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the "right ", as represented by Barth, rests on the following thesis: The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that (1) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation; (2) accepts instead a special biblical <b>hermeneutics</b> or method of interpretation; and (3) in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's point of view, are mythological.</blockquote></div>
