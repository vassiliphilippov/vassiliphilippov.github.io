            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Even in the united states, with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast denominational differentiation, there is a general <b>consensus</b> regarding the basic Christian values.</blockquote><blockquote>In the absence of a reservoir of political <b>consensus</b> each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence, but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent.</blockquote><blockquote>Lacking the respected and effective institutions that <b>consensus</b> helps provide, minority parties, such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction in 1958, clamor for elections when out of power, but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power.</blockquote></div>
