            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>MacLean stressed correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species, as evidenced by the influence of the limbic brain (including the hypothalamus) on <b>emotions</b> related to fight and flight and also on sexual functions.</blockquote><blockquote>The foregoing remarks imply that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological forms of <b>emotion</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>If this is the case, one would expect that not only the various procedures just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that <b>emotion</b> itself would act likewise.</blockquote><blockquote>We pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders and neurotic symptoms, particularly in certain types of personality, but it is also known that the reliving of a strong <b>emotion</b> ("abreaction ") may cure a battle neurosis.</blockquote><blockquote>This phenomenon raises the question whether the guidance of the <b>emotions</b> for therapeutic ends may not have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses.</blockquote></div>
