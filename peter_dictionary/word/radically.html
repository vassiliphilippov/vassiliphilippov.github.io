            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Such an interpretation of death <b>radically</b> alters the Christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation from, not salvation in, time and history.</blockquote><blockquote>This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness of <b>radically</b> different value orientation elsewhere; for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism.</blockquote><blockquote>To find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory <b>radically</b>, and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery.</blockquote><blockquote>Many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with <b>radically</b> new ideas; the poet of the Iliad deliberately archaized.</blockquote><blockquote>I was having lunch not long ago (apologies to N. V. Peale) with three distinguished historians (one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been <b>radically</b> changed with "deliberate speed, majestic instancy " (Francis Thompson's words for the Hound of Heaven's pursuit) by judicial fiat.</blockquote></div>
