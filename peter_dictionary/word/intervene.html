S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo, sending Lumumba equipment for his "wars ", dispatching "technicians "and even threatening, on occasion, to <b>intervene</b> openly.</blockquote></div>
