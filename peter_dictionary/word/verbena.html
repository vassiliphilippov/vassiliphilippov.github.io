            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned over by a dusty slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked in the ragged, brown edged holes; hot colored <b>verbenas</b> in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on our way to the pump with the half gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.</blockquote><blockquote>It was mother who planted the <b>verbenas</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>My great grandmother, I have been told, made her garden her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon <b>verbenas</b> in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed, and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house.</blockquote></div>
