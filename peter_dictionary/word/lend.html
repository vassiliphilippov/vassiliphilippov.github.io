S. government; householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent, under government aegis.</blockquote><blockquote>To Voltaire's surprise, however, their host gives them fresh clothes to put on, opens his purse to <b>lend</b> them money and sits them down before a good dinner.</blockquote><blockquote>Government itself was based upon contract; business organization - the corporation - was analyzed in contractual terms; trade was based on freedom of contract, and money was <b>lent</b> and borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement.</blockquote><blockquote>Public libraries in Nassau County have been <b>lending</b> books to each other by mail for a quarter-century, but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis.</blockquote></div>
