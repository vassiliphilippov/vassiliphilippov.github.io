            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent, who had <b>broken with</b> his parents in order to keep the company he preferred - pimps, panders and whores.</blockquote><blockquote>He may support China (but he won n't); he may <b>break with</b> China (which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous), or he may succeed, by all kinds of dangerous concessions, in persuading China to be patient.</blockquote><blockquote>Although he later <b>broke with</b> the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout Christian.</blockquote></div>
