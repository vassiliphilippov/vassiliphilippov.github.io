            <div class="definition">Electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun, including visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared rays, that reaches the Earth or other bodies in space.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The infrared emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon, while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface, where the temperature variation due to <b>solar radiation</b> is reduced in amplitude and shifted in phase.</blockquote><blockquote>The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length <b>solar radiation</b> would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1 ` K.</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore, neglecting the extreme outbursts, reflected <b>solar radiation</b> is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter wave-length range.</blockquote><blockquote>The Poynting-Robertson effect (Robertson, 1937; Wyatt and Whipple, 1950), which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging <b>solar radiation</b>, causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much shorter than the age of the Earth.</blockquote><blockquote>Whipple (1955) extends the effects to include the <b>solar</b> corpuscular radiation pressure, which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag.</blockquote></div>
