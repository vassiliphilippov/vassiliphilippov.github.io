            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago - a new bedroom set or a winter coat, an Easter bonnet, a bicycle for Junior - the family set off for the downtown <b>department store</b>, where the selection would be greatest.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Department stores</b> congregated in the "one hundred per cent location ", where all the transit lines converged.</blockquote><blockquote>Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car, the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown <b>department store</b>, though both are the same distance from home.</blockquote><blockquote>And if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with "nice people ", rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown <b>department store</b>, the central location may be in serious trouble.</blockquote><blockquote>The downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety, both within its gates and across the street, where other <b>department stores</b> are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind.</blockquote></div>
