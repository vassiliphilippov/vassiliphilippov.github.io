            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>My great grandmother, I have been told, made her garden her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the <b>garden heliotrope</b> in a corner by the woodshed, and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house.</blockquote></div>

                <h3>Etymology</h3>
                <p class="etymology-body">Heliotrope: from Greek 'helios' (sun) + 'tropos' (turning), though in this context, the name refers to the plant's fragrance, not botanical relation to true heliotropes.</p>
