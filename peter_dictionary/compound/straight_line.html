            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>straight line</b> would symbolize its uniqueness, the circle its universality.</blockquote><blockquote>Not a circle, then, nor a <b>straight line</b>, but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence.</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, the spiral <b>f, with the two endpoints connected by a </b>straight line** possesses only one inscribed square.</blockquote><blockquote>The square has one corner point on the <b>straight line</b> segment, and does not lie entirely in the interior.</blockquote><blockquote>The roots of this equation are just the ordinates of the intersections of the graph of b with a <b>straight line</b> of unit slope through **f in the b-plane (the plane of the graph of b).</blockquote></div>
