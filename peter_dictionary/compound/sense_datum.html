            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of <b>sense data</b> arranged in such and such sequence and pattern, devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection.</blockquote><blockquote>Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely <b>sense data</b> in abstraction from causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world, not directly perceived.</blockquote><blockquote>As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated <b>sense data</b>, most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical scepticism.</blockquote></div>
