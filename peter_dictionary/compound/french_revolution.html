            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>A British writer, Richard Haestier, in a book, Dead Men Tell Tales, recalls that in the turmoil preceding <b>French Revolution</b> the body of Henry /4,, who had died nearly 180 years earlier, was torn to pieces by a mob.</blockquote><blockquote>The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity, however, prepared the way for a reception of the <b>French Revolution</b>'s socialistic offspring of one sort of another.</blockquote><blockquote>However, it is important to trace the philosophy of the <b>French Revolution</b> to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet, after Rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will, the same philosophy, it may be said, became the idea source of the <b>French Revolution</b> also.</blockquote></div>
