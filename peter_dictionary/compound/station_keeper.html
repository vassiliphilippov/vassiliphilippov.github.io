            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>"He let a patrolman take over the duties of the <b>station keeper</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>He sucked in his breath and kept quiet while Killpath laid down the sheet again, wound the gold wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then, eying the report as it lay before him on the desk, intoned, "Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson one failed to see that the <b>station keeper</b> was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander Acting Captain O. T. Killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six "- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses "- failed to co-operate with the Acting Captain by returning promptly when so ordered.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office, he nodded and said good night to the <b>station keeper</b> and his clerks, not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out.</blockquote></div>
