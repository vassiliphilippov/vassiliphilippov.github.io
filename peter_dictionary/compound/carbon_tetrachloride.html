            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It appears possible to set a lower limit of about * * f for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a <b>carbon tetrachloride</b> molecule by a chlorine atom to form * * f radical.</blockquote><blockquote>The reaction of chlorine with <b>carbon tetrachloride</b> seemed particularly suited for such studies.</blockquote><blockquote>It should be possible to free <b>carbon tetrachloride</b> of any interfering substances by the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine.</blockquote><blockquote>We are reporting these investigations here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atoms from <b>carbon tetrachloride</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt, low sulfur, reagent grade <b>carbon tetrachloride</b> were saturated with * * f and * * f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches.</blockquote></div>
