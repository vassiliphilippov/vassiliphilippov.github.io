            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still <b>in operation</b>, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote><blockquote>The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption in State programs already <b>in operation</b>, which might otherwise result from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population alone.</blockquote></div>
