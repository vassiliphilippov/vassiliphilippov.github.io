George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of <b>day schools</b> for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.</blockquote><blockquote>It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide <b>day schools</b> for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here.</blockquote><blockquote>It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the <b>day schools</b>, permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here.</blockquote><blockquote>Operating budget for the <b>day schools</b> in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso would be $ 451500, which would be a savings of $ 157460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $ 88000 was absorbed, Parkhouse told the Senate.</blockquote><blockquote>The TEA estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the <b>day school</b> in Dallas County, saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.</blockquote></div>
