            <div class="definition">An electromagnetic wave in the radio part of the spectrum, typically with wavelengths between 0.5 cm and 30,000 m, especially as emitted by astronomical objects.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It has recently become practical to use the <b>radio emission</b> of the moon and planets as a new source of information about these bodies and their atmospheres.</blockquote><blockquote>The results of present observations of the thermal <b>radio emission</b> of the moon are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses (e.g., Garstung, 1958).</blockquote><blockquote>Observations of the <b>radio emission</b> of a planet which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics of the solid surface.</blockquote><blockquote>The observed intensity of the <b>radio emission</b> of Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity, although the spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 cm and 10 cm is like that of a black body at about 600 ` K.</blockquote><blockquote>For the case of Jupiter, the <b>radio emission</b> spectrum is definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator, and it seems very likely that the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non thermal components.</blockquote></div>
