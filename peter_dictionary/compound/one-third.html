            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost <b>one-third</b> of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote><blockquote>The measured powder density of the <b>f used here was about </b>f, approximately **one-third** that of the crystal density (**f).</blockquote><blockquote>The velocity value used is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction of the dust is orbiting about the Earth, only about <b>one third</b> the above mentioned average velocity should be used in deriving the mass.</blockquote><blockquote>About <b>one-third</b> as long, it is less intimate and detailed, but better coordinated, more concise and more dramatic.</blockquote><blockquote>The subjects for this study were randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution, <b>one-third</b> as underachievers, one-third medium, and one-third over-achievers.</blockquote></div>
