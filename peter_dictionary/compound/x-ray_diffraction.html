            <div class="definition">A technique in which X rays are scattered by the atoms of a crystal, producing a diffraction pattern that reveals the crystal's structure.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Douglass has studied the crystal structure of <b>f by </b>x-ray diffraction**.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>x-ray diffraction</b> pattern of the material, taken with CuKla radiation, indicated the presence of no extra lines and was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, there are persons who are in physical science, in the field of mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only X-rays, applying only the powder technique of <b>X-ray diffraction</b>, to clay minerals only, and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology, studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians.</blockquote></div>
