            <div class="definition">An atom or group of atoms that contains at least one unpaired electron, making it highly reactive; commonly found in body processes and chemical reactions.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and <b>free radicals</b>, as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon halogen bond.</blockquote><blockquote>To secure precise measurements of these frequencies, a research program in <b>free radical</b> microwave spectroscopy has been started.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>in the body free radicals are high-energy particles that ricochet wildly and damage cells</blockquote></div>
