            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in <b>natural law</b> theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still.</blockquote><blockquote>The grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament), the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the <b>natural law</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The Roman Catholic <b>natural-law</b> tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course it had always been of European origin in fact, but it had maintained a universal outlook under the <b>natural law</b> theory.</blockquote></div>
