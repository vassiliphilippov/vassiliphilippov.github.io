            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>writes: Does the cholesterol go down when most of the <b>thyroid gland</b> is removed?</blockquote><blockquote>In the <b>thyroid gland</b> it appears that proteins (chiefly thyroglobulin) are iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the circulating thyroid hormones are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine (cf. Section C), it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the <b>thyroid gland</b> for their release from proteins before secretion.</blockquote><blockquote>The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases is increased in <b>thyroid glands</b> from TSH treated animals suggests that this protease may be active in vivo.</blockquote><blockquote>Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet, the level of iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity of the <b>thyroid gland</b>.</blockquote></div>
