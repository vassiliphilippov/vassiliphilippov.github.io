            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle: (1) <b>Fence-line</b> bunks - cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self unloading wagons; (2) Mechanized bunks - they sit within the feed lot, are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; (3) Special bunks - as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides.</blockquote><blockquote>Animals eat only from one side, so the <b>fence-line</b> bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk.</blockquote><blockquote>Because of their location, on the edge of the feed lot, <b>fence-line</b> bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal.</blockquote></div>
