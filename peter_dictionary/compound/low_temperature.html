            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining planets have been reported, and, because of their distances, small diameters, or <b>low temperatures</b>, the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very low intensity.</blockquote><blockquote>For the <b>low-temperature</b> measurements the sample was cooled by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and Eades.</blockquote><blockquote>One sample, which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375 ` C, showed the presence of adsorbed water (about 0.3 wt %) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow at room temperature and which disappeared, due to broadening, at <b>low temperature</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>These include <b>low-temperature</b> ethanol (Cohn) fractionation, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses.</blockquote></div>
