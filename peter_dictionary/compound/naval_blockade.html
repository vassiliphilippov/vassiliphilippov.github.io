            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Mr. Speaker, in my latest newsletter to my constituents I urged the imposition of a <b>naval blockade</b> of Cuba as the only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine.</blockquote><blockquote>Personally, I think we ought to set up an immediate <b>naval blockade</b> of Cuba.</blockquote><blockquote>A <b>naval blockade</b> would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine, would be a relatively simple operation to carry out, and would bring an abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere ".</blockquote><blockquote>Military experts say a tight <b>naval blockade</b> off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require two naval task forces, each built around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers.</blockquote></div>
