            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow, director of the United States Information Agency, came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the <b>motion picture</b> industry.</blockquote><blockquote>"Designs, plans and furnishes interiors of houses, commercial and institutional structures, hotels, clubs, ships, theaters, as well as set decorations for <b>motion picture</b> arts and television.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Motion-picture</b> exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square.</blockquote><blockquote>In response, the industry allowed the discovery of the <b>motion picture</b> as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day.</blockquote><blockquote>Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the <b>motion picture</b> the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained since, even in the most inept hands.</blockquote></div>
