            <div class="definition">The practice or conduct of a knight-errant; quixotic or romantic pursuit of chivalrous adventure, often regarded as impractical or idealistic.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>His addle-brained knight-errant, self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of <b>knight-errantry</b> had become a joke, is, as Cervantes no doubt intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.</blockquote></div>
