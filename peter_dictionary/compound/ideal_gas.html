            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties of an <b>ideal gas</b> that are analogous to rubber-like deformation.</blockquote><blockquote>The internal energy of an <b>ideal gas</b> depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume.</blockquote><blockquote>In other words, if an <b>ideal gas</b> is compressed and kept at constant temperature, the work done in compressing it is completely converted into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink.</blockquote><blockquote>There is a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that * * f, where \q is the probability that state (i.e., volume for an <b>ideal gas</b>) could be reached by chance alone.</blockquote><blockquote>Note that though the <b>ideal gas</b> itself contains no additional energy, the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure.</blockquote></div>
