            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding, along with Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right center, moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt <b>in front</b> of the plate.</blockquote><blockquote>Richard M. Forbes's Paget, which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages, tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head <b>in front</b> of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss.</blockquote><blockquote>Mills shot out <b>in front</b> and kept the lead through two thirds of the race.</blockquote><blockquote>Al Smith's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the campaign - tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back <b>in front</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>A double by Green, Allison's run scoring 2 baser, an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back <b>in front</b> in the last of the fifth.</blockquote></div>
