            <div class="definition">A missile which is guided during the initial part of its flight but follows a ballistic trajectory and falls freely as it heads towards its target.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>For example, the importance of the Regulus 2,, a very promising aerodynamic ship to surface missile designed to be launched by surfaced submarines, was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration of the much more advanced Polaris <b>ballistic missile</b> launched by submerged submarines.</blockquote><blockquote>The substantial progress being made in <b>ballistic missile</b> technology is rapidly shifting the main threat from manned bombers to missiles.</blockquote><blockquote>Notable in this category are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range <b>ballistic missiles</b>, which have been successfully developed, produced, and deployed, but the relative importance of which has diminished with the increasing availability of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile.</blockquote><blockquote>This aircraft, which was planned for initial operational use about 1965, would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic <b>ballistic missile</b> systems, all of which are scheduled to become available earlier.</blockquote></div>
