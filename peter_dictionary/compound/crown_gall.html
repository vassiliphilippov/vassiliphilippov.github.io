            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In attempting to improve specificity of staining, the fluorescein labeled antisera used in both direct and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways: (1) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone insoluble powders (Coons, 1958) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stems or <b>crown gall</b> tissue produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (E. F. Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover stems.</blockquote><blockquote>Sections of <b>crown gall</b> tissue similarly stained with either * * f and * * f or NS and * * f also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence.</blockquote><blockquote>Two absorptions of * * f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of * * f (which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride), NS and * * f with <b>crown gall</b> tissue powder, or mouse liver powder did not further improve the specificity of staining.</blockquote><blockquote>After these treatments the conjugate did not stain healthy or <b>crown gall</b> sweet clover tissues or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining.</blockquote><blockquote>The specificity of staining in WTV tumors with * * f and * * f but not with NS and * * f or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus and * * f, and the absence of such staining in <b>crown gall</b> tumor tissue from sweet-clover, indicate that an antigen of WTV was being stained.</blockquote></div>
