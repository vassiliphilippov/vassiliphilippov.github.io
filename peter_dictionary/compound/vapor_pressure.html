            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The efforts and accomplishments fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based upon the velocity of sound in helium gas, secondary thermometry involving principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors, and helium 4 <b>vapor-pressure</b> measurements (see p. 144).</blockquote><blockquote>When values of temperature derived with this instrument were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid helium 4 <b>vapor pressures</b>, differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively were found.</blockquote><blockquote>Several germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree when temperatures were derived from a <b>vapor pressure</b> thermometer whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium.</blockquote><blockquote>The reproducibilities of helium <b>vapor-pressure</b> thermometers have been investigated in conjunction with a "constant temperature "liquid helium bath from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f.</blockquote><blockquote>A hydrostatic head correction has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of <b>vapor pressures</b> or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium.</blockquote></div>
