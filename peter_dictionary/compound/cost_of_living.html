            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases, and wage increases to offset <b>cost-of-living</b> increases, but we abstract from these forces here.</blockquote><blockquote>For our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate (not including productivity improvement factors or <b>cost-of-living</b> adjustments), and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs.</blockquote><blockquote>The existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for <b>cost-of-living</b> and productivity share increases as distinct from a cost raising increase in the basic wage rate.</blockquote></div>
