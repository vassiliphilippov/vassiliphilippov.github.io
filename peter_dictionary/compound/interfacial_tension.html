            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Just as the pressure exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is * * f and the pressure exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is * * f, the pressure exerted by any curved surface is * * f, where |g is the <b>interfacial tension</b> and * * f and * * f are the two radii of curvature.</blockquote><blockquote>If it is assumed that the formula given by Lodge of * * f, cosec 2lc applies, the pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle of inclination of the major axis, and from this the <b>interfacial tension</b> can be calculated.</blockquote><blockquote>In an essentially static system, an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the <b>interfacial tensions</b> of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active agent.</blockquote></div>
