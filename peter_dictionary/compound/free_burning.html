            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In <b>free burning</b> electric arcs, for instance, approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending on the arc atmosphere.</blockquote><blockquote>The higher heat transfer rates at the anode compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical phenomena occurring in <b>free burning</b> arcs.</blockquote><blockquote>The heat transfer to the anode in <b>free burning</b> arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f.</blockquote><blockquote>Hence, the flow conditions at the anode of <b>free burning</b> arcs resemble those near a stagnation point.</blockquote><blockquote>it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements for the anode of <b>free burning</b> arcs are large compared with those for the cathode.</blockquote></div>
