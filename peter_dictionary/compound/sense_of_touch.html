            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In any event, the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became "psychically blind ", while at the same time, apparently, the <b>sense of touch</b> remained essentially intact.</blockquote><blockquote>The necessary inference, as the authors themselves interpret it, would seem to be this: " (1) Spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the <b>sense of touch</b>, as such.</blockquote><blockquote>We do not arrive at spatial images by means of the <b>sense of touch</b> by itself.</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore, if the <b>sense of touch</b> is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled, the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary.</blockquote><blockquote>(3) How can we be sure that his <b>sense of touch</b> was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury?</blockquote></div>
