            <div class="definition">A faint, diffuse band of light in the sky, caused by sunlight reflecting off cosmic dust in the plane of the ecliptic, visible just before sunrise or after sunset.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>From the brightness of the F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the <b>zodiacal light</b>, an estimate of the particle sizes, concentrations, and spatial distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic plane.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Zodiacal light</b> and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket, a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture is in circular orbits about the sun, as indicated by the trend of the smaller visible meteors.</blockquote></div>

                <p class="etymology-body">From 'zodiac', referring to the band of constellations along the ecliptic, and 'light'. 'Zodiac' derives from Greek *zōidiakós* (of animals), from *zōidion* (little animal, sign of the zodiac).</p>
