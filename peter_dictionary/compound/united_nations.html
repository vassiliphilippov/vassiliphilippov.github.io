            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators, at the <b>United Nations</b>, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences - preferably at the highest level.</blockquote><blockquote>We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework, finally and at last, to rationalize war - to rationalize want and fear - out of the world: the <b>United Nations</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The senior policy officer may be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimuli: an idea in his own head, the suggestions of a colleague, a question from the Secretary or the President, a proposal by another department, a communication from a foreign government or an American ambassador abroad, the filing of an item for the agenda of the <b>United Nations</b> or of any other of dozens of international bodies, a news item read at the breakfast table, a question to the President or the Secretary at a news conference, a speech by a Senator or Congressman, an article in a periodical, a resolution from a national organization, a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad, et cetera, ad infinitum.</blockquote><blockquote>Is the matter one for the <b>United Nations</b> or some other international body?</blockquote></div>
