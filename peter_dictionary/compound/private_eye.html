            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The mythological <b>private eye</b> differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways.</blockquote><blockquote>Whatever his original assignment, the fictional <b>private eye</b> ends up by investigating and solving a crime, usually a murder.</blockquote><blockquote>By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and his freedom from external restraint, the <b>private eye</b> is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost.</blockquote><blockquote>In short, the fictional <b>private eye</b> is a specialized version of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare.</blockquote><blockquote>Sherlock Holmes, the ancestor of all <b>private eyes</b>, was born during the 1890 s.</blockquote></div>
