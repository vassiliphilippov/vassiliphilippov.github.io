            <div class="definition">A medieval knight who traveled widely in search of adventures and to prove their chivalry, often depicted in literature.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic <b>knight-errant</b> and his squire, Sancho Panza, in seventeenth century Spain, this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character.</blockquote><blockquote>His addle-brained <b>knight-errant</b>, self appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke, is, as Cervantes no doubt intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.</blockquote></div>
