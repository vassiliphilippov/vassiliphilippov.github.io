            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The concept of unity, in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always joined to the same phenomenon - such a concept is still reserved to the <b>physical sciences</b> and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>In the <b>physical sciences</b>, these achievements concern electricity, chemistry, and atomic physics.</blockquote><blockquote>For example, there are persons who are in <b>physical science</b>, in the field of mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only X-rays, applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction, to clay minerals only, and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology, studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians.</blockquote></div>
