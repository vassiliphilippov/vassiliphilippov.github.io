            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the category of <b>chamber music</b> - yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument generally regarded as symphonic.</blockquote><blockquote>We attended the premieres of his concertos, symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught, and performed his piano sonatas, <b>chamber music</b>, gavottes, and marches; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies; choruses, <b>chamber music</b> ensembles; soloists; recordings; broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences.</blockquote></div>
