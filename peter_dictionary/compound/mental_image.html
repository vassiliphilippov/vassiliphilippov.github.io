            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Every dream, and this is true of a <b>mental image</b> of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.</blockquote><blockquote>The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a <b>mental image</b> can find no logical support.</blockquote><blockquote>A "<b>mental image</b> "subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension.</blockquote><blockquote>Merely having a <b>mental image</b> of some sort is not the all-important consideration.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>her imagination forced images upon her too awful to contemplate</blockquote></div>
