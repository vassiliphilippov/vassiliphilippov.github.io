            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In a properly ordered society the massive force of <b>public law</b> performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still.</blockquote><blockquote>From its inception in 1920 with the passage of <b>Public Law</b> 236, 66 th Congress, the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been to assist the States, by means of grants-in-aid, to return disabled men and women to productive, gainful employment.</blockquote><blockquote>Recognizing the limitations of such a program, the 78 th Congress in 1943 passed <b>P. L.</b> 113, which broadened the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities, and which revised the financing structure.</blockquote><blockquote>To assist the States, therefore, in rehabilitating handicapped individuals, "so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment to the extent of their capabilities ", the 83 rd Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 (<b>P. L.</b> 565).</blockquote><blockquote>Under <b>P. L.</b> 113, 78 th Congress, the Federal Government assumed responsibility for 100 % of necessary State expenditures in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of the disabled, and for 50 % of the necessary costs of providing clients with rehabilitation case services.</blockquote></div>
