            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>No suburban <b>shopping-center</b> branch - not even Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit - does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store.</blockquote><blockquote>Just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car, the trip to the <b>shopping center</b> may seem far easier than to the downtown department store, though both are the same distance from home.</blockquote><blockquote>Today, according to land economist Homer Hoyt, <b>shopping centers</b> and their associated parking lots cover some 46000 acres of land, which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's Central Business Districts put together.</blockquote><blockquote>The major contributor was a <b>shopping center</b> with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed.</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, the wastewater would be entirely from the <b>shopping center</b> with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18 - month period.</blockquote></div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Synset Examples</h3><blockquote>a good plaza should have a movie house</blockquote><blockquote>they spent their weekends at the local malls</blockquote></div>
