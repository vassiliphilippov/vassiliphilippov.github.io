            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It is true that his first collage looks more <b>Analytical</b> than Braque's, which would confirm the date he assigns it.</blockquote><blockquote>But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography; and moreover, he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of <b>Analytical Cubism</b> as far back as the end of 1910.</blockquote><blockquote>In the <b>Analytical</b> phase of their Cubism, Braque and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it - to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself.</blockquote><blockquote>When the smaller facet-planes of <b>Analytical Cubism</b> were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large, dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to coalesce - become "synthesized "- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Analytical Cubism</b> came to an end in the collage, but not conclusively; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully begin there.</blockquote></div>
