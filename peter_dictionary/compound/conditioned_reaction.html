            <div class="definition">A learned response that occurs when a previously neutral stimulus comes to elicit a specific reaction due to repeated association with another stimulus; also called a conditional reflex.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>A previously extinguished <b>conditioned reaction</b> was restored in monkey A and was associated with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic discharges.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, <b>conditioned reactions</b> are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level, and several types of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic "tuning "are observed.</blockquote><blockquote>If, for instance, such a change is produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks, previously inhibited <b>conditioned reactions</b> reappear.</blockquote><blockquote>It has further been shown that: (1) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance; (2) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter <b>conditioned reactions</b>; (3) in a state of depression, the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing (alerting) effect on the EEG.</blockquote><blockquote>It has further been shown that: (1) an experimental neurosis in its initial stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance; (2) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned reactions; (3) in a state of depression, the positive conditioned stimulus may fail to elicit a <b>conditioned reaction</b> but cause an increased synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing (alerting) effect on the EEG.</blockquote></div>
