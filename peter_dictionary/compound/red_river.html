            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands, conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the <b>Red River</b> of the North.</blockquote><blockquote>Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to <b>Red River</b> where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire.</blockquote><blockquote>On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the <b>Red River</b>, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces.</blockquote><blockquote>His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of <b>Red River</b> and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts.</blockquote><blockquote>During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach <b>Red River</b> and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England.</blockquote></div>
