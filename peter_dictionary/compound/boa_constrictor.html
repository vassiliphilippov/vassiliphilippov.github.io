            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>There seems to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate lengths, starting with the smallest (<b>boa constrictor</b>) and ending with the largest (anaconda).</blockquote><blockquote>For four of the six (the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length, the <b>boa constrictor</b> being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the former stage.</blockquote><blockquote>There are few data on the <b>boa constrictor</b>, those for the anaconda are unconvincing, and there is nothing at all on the amethystine python.</blockquote><blockquote>The best way to determine the correct figure (in captives) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth, a method that produced surprising results: maturing of a male Indian python in less than two years, his mate in less than three; data on the <b>boa constrictor</b> about match this.</blockquote><blockquote>the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet, the reticulate python 33, the African rock python 25, the amethystine python at least 22, the Indian python 20, and the <b>boa constrictor</b> 18 - 1 2.</blockquote></div>
