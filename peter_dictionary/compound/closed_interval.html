            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>This set must consist of isolated points and <b>closed intervals</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except in <b>closed intervals</b> follows from the argument used in Lemma 1, namely, that near any tangent point in the C-plane the curves C and **f are analytic, and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point.</blockquote><blockquote>The first possibility results in a <b>closed interval</b> of tangent points in the f-plane, the end points of which fall into category (b) or (c).</blockquote></div>
