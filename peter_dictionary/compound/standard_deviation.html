            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Although the <b>standard deviation</b> values on which spread of the lines are based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early (Table 1), there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed Onsets.</blockquote><blockquote>The upper curve denotes the mean plus one <b>standard deviation</b>, and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation.</blockquote><blockquote>The upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation, and the lower curve represents the mean minus one <b>standard deviation</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the <b>standard deviation</b> values for each center in Table 1.</blockquote><blockquote>At the top of Figure 5, for example, the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and <b>standard deviation</b> values in Table 1.</blockquote></div>
