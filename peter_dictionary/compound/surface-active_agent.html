            <div class="definition">A chemical compound that reduces the surface tension of a liquid in which it is dissolved, often used to enhance the spreading or wetting properties of the liquid.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>As is the case with the <b>surface-active agent</b>, the requirements for builders to be used in detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high.</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, when the proper inorganic constituents are employed, practically any wetting or <b>surface-active agent</b> will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard surface cleaning formulation.</blockquote><blockquote>In an essentially static system, an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a <b>surface-active agent</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>Whereas the usual organic <b>surface-active agent</b> is strongly sorbed at oil-water interfaces, the highly charged ions are most strongly sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting an ionic structure (see Table 26 - 2 on p. 1678).</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, for aqueous media, we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic or hydrophobic <b>surface-active agent</b>, and of an idealized builder as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.</blockquote></div>
