            <div class="definition">A geometric plane that constitutes one of the flat surfaces (facets) of an object, such as a cube; especially used in mathematics, crystallography, and art (e.g., Cubism) to describe these surfaces.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Through 1911 and 1912, as the Cubist <b>facet-plane</b>'s tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny, the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances.</blockquote><blockquote>But it is also true that Braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography; and moreover, he had already begun to broaden and simplify the <b>facet-planes</b> of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910.</blockquote><blockquote>In order to be saved, plasticity had had to be isolated; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour obliterating <b>facet-planes</b> by which plasticity was isolated under the Cubist method, the subject itself became largely unrecognizable.</blockquote><blockquote>When the smaller <b>facet-planes</b> of Analytical Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large, dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to coalesce - become "synthesized "- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane.</blockquote></div>
