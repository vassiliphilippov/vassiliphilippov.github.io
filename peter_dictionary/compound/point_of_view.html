            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the "right ", as represented by Barth, rests on the following thesis: The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that (1) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation; (2) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation; and (3) in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's <b>point of view</b>, are mythological.</blockquote><blockquote>It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic <b>point of view</b> at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine.</blockquote><blockquote>The opposition to this <b>point of view</b> has its staunchest support in the work of Miller (' 50).</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore, he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his <b>point of view</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>From the manufacturer's <b>point of view</b>, the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties.</blockquote></div>
