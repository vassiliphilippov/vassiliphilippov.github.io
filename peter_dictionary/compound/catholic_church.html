            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the <b>Catholic Church</b> is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches.</blockquote><blockquote>Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation "; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a <b>Catholic church</b> in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.</blockquote></div>
