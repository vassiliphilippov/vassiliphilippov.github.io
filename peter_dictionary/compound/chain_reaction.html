            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Furthermore, the exchange would not be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it would not be apt to be a <b>chain reaction</b> since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be too high; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities as a scavenger for * * f radicals.</blockquote><blockquote>It was because of this <b>chain-reaction</b> as much as for any other reason - that is, because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape - that the identity of depicted objects, or at least parts of them, re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes - than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913.</blockquote></div>
