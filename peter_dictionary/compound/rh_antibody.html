            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Abelson and Rawson, using a stepwise elution scheme, fractionated whole sera containing ABO and <b>Rh antibodies</b> on diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose.</blockquote><blockquote>The activities of fractions of sera containing <b>Rh antibodies</b> were tested by the saline, albumin and indirect Coombs techniques.</blockquote><blockquote>The red cells for the <b>Rh antibody</b> tests were used within 3 days after drawing except for the * * f cells, which had been glycerolized and stored at - 20 ` C for approximately 1 year.</blockquote><blockquote>Chromatography of whole sera revealed that the areas of <b>Rh antibody</b> activity were generally continuous and wide.</blockquote></div>
