            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>For four of the six (the anaconda and the amethystine python cannot be included for lack of data) there is also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length, the boa constrictor being the smallest and the <b>Indian python</b> the next in size at the former stage.</blockquote><blockquote>When it comes to rate of early growth, the <b>Indian python</b> leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the first two years, more or less.</blockquote><blockquote>It seems likely that the <b>Indian python</b> comes out ahead because records of its growth have been made more carefully and frequently; it responds exceptionally well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to keep.</blockquote><blockquote>The best way to determine the correct figure (in captives) is by direct observation of pairs isolated from birth, a method that produced surprising results: maturing of a male <b>Indian python</b> in less than two years, his mate in less than three; data on the boa constrictor about match this.</blockquote><blockquote>the anaconda reaches a length of at least 37 feet, the reticulate python 33, the African rock python 25, the amethystine python at least 22, the <b>Indian python</b> 20, and the boa constrictor 18 - 1 2.</blockquote></div>
