            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Since <b>marginal costs</b> rise when the wage rate rises, the profit maximizing price also rises when the public limit price is elevated, and is likely to remain well above the latter.</blockquote><blockquote>We assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced (the average cost curve is horizontal, and therefore is identical with the <b>marginal cost</b> curve), and is the same for every firm (and therefore for the industry).</blockquote><blockquote>The level of average cost (equal to <b>marginal cost</b>) is thus strictly a function of the wage rate.</blockquote></div>
