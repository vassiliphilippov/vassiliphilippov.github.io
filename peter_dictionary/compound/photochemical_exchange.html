            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>photochemical exchange</b> occurs with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65 ` using light absorbed only by the * * f.</blockquote><blockquote>The liquid phase <b>photochemical exchange</b> between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible than the thermal exchange, although still erratic.</blockquote><blockquote>Although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects, the <b>photochemical exchange</b> in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate.</blockquote></div>
