            <div class="definition">Any of several closely related hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are active in regulating metabolism.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Since the circulating <b>thyroid hormones</b> are the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine (cf. Section C), it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their release from proteins before secretion.</blockquote><blockquote>This ion inhibits <b>thyroid hormone</b> synthesis by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid.</blockquote><blockquote>Any of the antithyroid drugs, of either type, if given in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre, owing to inhibition of <b>thyroid hormone</b> synthesis, with production of hypothyroidism.</blockquote><blockquote>Further, the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction of the <b>thyroid hormone</b> de-iodinated peripherally.</blockquote></div>
