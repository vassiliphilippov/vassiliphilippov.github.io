            <div class="definition">A probability distribution that gives the likelihood of a fixed number of successes in a specified number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>binomial</b> probability distribution may describe the variation that occurs from one set of trials of such a binomial experiment to another.</blockquote><blockquote>We devote a chapter to the <b>binomial distribution</b> not only because it is a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomena, but also because it has important properties that recur in many other probability models.</blockquote><blockquote>When each number of successes x is paired with its probability of occurrence * * f, the set of pairs * * f, is a probability function called a <b>binomial distribution</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>The choice of p and n determines the <b>binomial distribution</b> uniquely, and different choices always produce different distributions (except when * * f; then the number of successes is always 0).</blockquote><blockquote>The set of all <b>binomial distributions</b> is called the family of binomial distributions, but in general discussions this expression is often shortened to "the binomial distribution ", or even "the binomial "when the context is clear.</blockquote></div>
