            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Abelson and Rawson, using a stepwise elution scheme, fractionated whole sera containing ABO and Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl <b>DEAE cellulose</b> and carboxymethyl cellulose.</blockquote><blockquote>Speer and coworkers, in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole sera, used a series of gradients for elution from <b>DEAE-cellulose</b>.</blockquote><blockquote>In the present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on <b>DEAE-cellulose</b> using single gradients similar to those described by Sober and Peterson, and certain chemical and serological properties of the fractions containing antibodies of the ABO and Rh systems have been described.</blockquote><blockquote>After dialysis the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a * * f cm column of <b>DEAE-cellulose</b> equilibrated with starting buffer.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>DEAE-cellulose</b>, containing 0.78 mEq of N / g, was prepared in our laboratory by the method of Peterson and Sober (7) from powdered cellulose, 100 - 230 mesh.</blockquote></div>
