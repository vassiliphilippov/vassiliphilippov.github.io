            <div class="definition">A hit in baseball that allows the batter to round all the bases and score a run, usually by hitting the ball out of the playing field in fair territory.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Jim Landis' 380 - foot <b>home run</b> over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1 - 0 lead, but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.</blockquote><blockquote>Al Smith's 340 - blast over left in the fourth - his fourth homer of the campaign - tied the score and Carreon's first major league <b>home run</b> in the fifth put the Sox back in front.</blockquote><blockquote>The spectacular Mays, who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25, joined six other sluggers who walloped four <b>home runs</b> in a span of nine innings.</blockquote><blockquote>In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 <b>home runs</b> and stole as many as 25 bases.</blockquote><blockquote>THE DENVER-AREA TV audience was privileged to see Mays' four <b>home runs</b>, thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home.</blockquote></div>
