            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms for the thermal and <b>photochemical reactions</b> in both the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals, as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon halogen bond.</blockquote><blockquote>The <b>photochemical reaction</b> cells consisted of 10 mm. i.d. Pyrex tubing, 5.5 cm. long, diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed through only liquid glass interfaces and not gas glass interfaces.</blockquote></div>
