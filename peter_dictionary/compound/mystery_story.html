            <div class="definition">A story, typically in novel, play, or film form, that revolves around the investigation of a crime, especially a murder, and the gradual revelation of clues and motives.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In the <b>mystery story</b>, as in The Wealth of Nations, individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, although the roots of the <b>mystery story</b> in serious literature go back as far as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades of the 19 th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction.</blockquote><blockquote>Even on the fictional level, however, the contradictions which give rise to the <b>mystery story</b> are not fully resolved.</blockquote><blockquote>The basic premise of all <b>mystery stories</b> is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal.</blockquote><blockquote>It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the <b>mystery story</b>.</blockquote></div>
