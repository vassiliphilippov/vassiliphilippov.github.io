Roebuck ".</blockquote><blockquote>Quickly but carefully lowering my <b>duffel bag</b> over the low side rack, I stepped on the running board; it flopped down, sprang back up and gouged my shin.</blockquote><blockquote>I seized the rack and made a western style flying mount just in time, one of my knees mercifully landing on my <b>duffel bag</b> - and merely wrecking my camera, I was to discover later - my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and - but this is no medical report.</blockquote></div>
