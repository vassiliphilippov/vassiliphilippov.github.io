            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>civil services</b> in such societies are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing them; and their members often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice, self-discipline, and competence.</blockquote><blockquote>The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957, but the P.D.I. (Parti Democratique de l'Independance), the most important minor party at the time, objected to the Istiqlal's predominance in the <b>civil service</b> and influence in Radio Maroc.</blockquote></div>
