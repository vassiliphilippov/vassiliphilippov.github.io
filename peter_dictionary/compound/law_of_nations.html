            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>In the century from 1815 to 1914 the <b>law of nations</b> became international law.</blockquote><blockquote>A number of other nineteenth century developments contributed to the transmutation of the <b>law of nations</b> into international law; that is, from aspects of a universal system of Justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states.</blockquote><blockquote>The difference is important, for although the older <b>law of nations</b> did cover relationships among sovereigns, this was by no means its exclusive domain.</blockquote><blockquote>No longer did the sovereign look to the <b>law of nations</b> to determine what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action.</blockquote><blockquote>One result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the <b>law of nations</b>.</blockquote></div>
