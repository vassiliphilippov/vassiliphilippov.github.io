            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>The <b>value-system</b> of a community or society is always correlated with, and to a degree dependent upon, a more or less shared system of religious beliefs and convictions.</blockquote><blockquote>Without a system of <b>values</b> there can be no society.</blockquote><blockquote>Where such a <b>value system</b> prevails, it always unifies all who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system.</blockquote><blockquote>Essentially this imposed two conditions: First, international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive, suspicious, and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another; second, it had to be compatible with the <b>value system</b> that they shared.</blockquote></div>
