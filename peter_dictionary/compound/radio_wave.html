            <div class="definition">An electromagnetic wave with a wavelength between about 0.5 centimeters and 30,000 meters, used especially for broadcasting and communication.</div>
            <div class="examples"><h3>Examples</h3><blockquote>Piddington and Minnett explained their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to <b>radio waves</b>, although opaque to infrared radiation.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the absorption of <b>radio waves</b> in rocklike material varies with wave length, it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material.</blockquote></div>
